# Mobile Robot I/O

This is the _Mobile Robot IO (MRIO)_ website respository.

**MRIO** works on software development projects and charges a one time,
fee based on time or task.

**ClowdOps** is an internal project to develop a service we will offer
certain clients

The service can be generally titled "managed cloud services".  Though,
it is our goal to refine the particulars of the service, based on
understanding the _most painful needs_ of our _clients_.

> The purpose of this site is to put specific meaning to the words
> above.  And choose the appropriate titles.
