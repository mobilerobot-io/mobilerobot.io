I can make your website better if one or more of these are true:

- I don't know if my website is actually doing my business any good.
- I did not really have a clear plan when I had it built
- It's disorganized and quite frankly a mess
- It was built with WordPress

If any of the above are true, I can make your website a lot better.
Under one condition, you have one or more specific goals that can be
measured and tracked.
