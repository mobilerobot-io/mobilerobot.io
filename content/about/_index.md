The version of mobile robot I am trying to build here is of the
[_Rover Style Vehical_](http://todo/rover-reference) 4 wheeled, skid
steer persuation.  It must be capable of streaming live video while
being controlled remotely by human or on vehical by software, at the
humans descretion, at least for now any way...
<!--more-->

An even more ambitious goal has the vehicle using the live video
stream as an input to perform it's _Guidance & Navigation_ function.
This will most likely be accomplished by feeding an AI like framework
such as OpenCV to perform some specific _Machine Learning_
algorithms. 

## Project Goals and Objectives

In building this project, I set out to state the major goals and
objectives, primarily to keep myself focused on an end object with a
very measurable goal, that can be marked as **complete**.

Here are the high level objectives:

- Vehical that can be controlled by humans with a remote control
- live video stream for human consumption
- live video stream fed to computer vision software
- video and image storage for post/static processing 
- self guided control software
  
The choice of human vs. computer controlled lies at the discretion of
the human (for now), except, perhaps, in cases that the human looses
communication with the vehicle.

This website basically documents the results, mistakes and what I have
_discovered_ a long the way, both discovery the best way to build the
vehicle, notes, and practicle and useable advice from the production
lines. 

## Agency [Ignore This Solicitation!]

Please do not read this if solicitations offend you!

I will happily take on a few programming gigs to help fund this
effort!  Also, I would like put together an agency that specializes in
building customized automation and robotic systems with modern
hardware.
