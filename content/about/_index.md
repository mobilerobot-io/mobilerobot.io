My name is George Eddy, but my friends call me Rusty.  I am a Software
Engineer by Trade and Education.  While I have always been fascinated
with Robotics (and of forms of embedded systems), but these days I am
~~almost~~ obsessed with this stuff.

My software background, though very broad has largely been writing
software for computer networks, servers and cloud automation.  I have
had many brushes with embedded systems over the years, have always
enjoyed it.

### Availability is a Game Changer!

Today it is unbelievable to me the power of ridiculously inexpensive
but full power computers and electronics attachments and gizmo's.  It
is truley mind boggling all the cool stuff.

### No more sleeping in Labs

Back in the day, only computer labs at large high tech companies and
universities had the goods, if you wanted or needed access, you had to
go to the lab, and the network.

There was no Internet.  No mobile phones.

Sleeping at the lab, or hanging out at 2:30am on a Friday Evening was
normal.  

Good times!

But, for the better technology is so prevalent and affordable, it is
no longer access to, and control of the technology that dictates who
can do what.  And exactly how creative you can be.

Nowadays, great things are easily in the hands of "normal" people, as
a completely diverse set of people have access, the game now becomes
truely, your imagination.  The sky is only a limit...


### This Project

I wamt to build a mobile robot that takes video, and indeed uses video
to drive itself (and a bunch of other stuff!), an automous driving
robot with a video camera to capture and stream live video images as
it moves about.

## I do NOT know What I am Doing!

This is an ambitious project to be sure, first because _robots_ are
complex animals requiring a level of mastery over complext topics
subjects such as Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, Software and
Communication Architecture and even websites and servers.

It is especially a challenge since we are NOT experts at any (well
maybe a couple) of the topics required to build a Robot or self
driving vehical.

### Some Skills I would Love to Acquire

- Electrical Engineering (and better soldering!)
- 3D Modeling / Printing
- Custom Fabrication
- More Organized Software
