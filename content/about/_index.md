This website was created to track and document the development of the
Mobile Robot Project, an attempt to build a Discovery Rover, a remote
controllable, video streaming discovery rover.  For under $500.

While this website documents the development of a specific mobile
robot. It is by no means an attempt to say this is **the** way to
build a mobile robot.

Rather, it is my intention to document The results of various Proof of
concepts that lead to our design decisions.  It  Is also a goal of this
project to create a set of modular and reusable blocks of hardware and
software that will aid in the _rapid prototyping_ of different
configurations of robots to support a variety of applications.

## Robotics Library

I intend to document a variety of design trade-offs as we come across
them.  It is my hope that the documents and other resources that I
stumble across are going to be of help, perhaps for a different
application or perhaps to understand the reasoning behind the choices
we do make.

## Shoulders of Giants and ReInventing the Wheel

At this point, early in The development of the robotic project, I
really don't know what alternatives are available, Nor do I have an
understanding of previous or existing works.

So there is no doubt that I am going to begin to reinvent the wheel in
the number of cases, But during that process discover the principal
challenges in developing a particular application.

In the process of doing so I expect we'll run across great pieces
of software that obselete peices of software we begin writing.
However, I do want to state that I am avoiding, at this very early
stage to avoid embracing specific technologies (arduino vs. raspberry
pi), or frameworks (Robot OS) and certainly proprietary systems, all
for the sake of _first principals_.

### Frameworks and First Principals

Frameworks (well written), when embraced early on, enforce industry
_best practices_ and remove large amounts of tedium and
insconsistancies inherent in building _systems_ of hardware and
software.

Because frameworks save the user from the _tedium_ and _learning
curves_ of underlying technologies that easily comes at the price of
understanding the underlything technologies, hence limiting the
developer to the _current_ capabilities of thier framework of choice.

It may also limit the range of solutions the Roboticiscts has
available at their discresion.

#### First Principals First

There is a high likelyhood that We embrace popular library packages
And indeed may be a framework or two, but they will have only been
selected because they have demonstrated the best fit for a given
application. 

By approaching our design by _First Principals_ have approached this
by learning first principles, Understanding our applications true
requirements, and only then mapping the application requirements to
the capabilities of a given library or framework, Can we really
achieve The maximum flexibility And powerfull solutions.

## Beyond The Basics

Without question this project is going to be about discovery.  We have
started taking on mini projects beyond the introductory and trivial.

Introductory material for virtually every aspect and technology that
will be used on the mobile robot project can be readily found on the
Internet. 

However, Finding material that goes beyond the introduction to a more
systematic development ofA real world projectBecomes trickier to find,
With a very good reason Hey well-built real-world systemIs difficult
to do. 

That makes sense for two reasons, difficult things are more difficult
to do and to document.  Second is because once you get beyond the
trivial technical tutorial, you are almost always connecting diverse
set of "tools" that constitute a _system_.

Documenting _systems_ is even harder than documenting even advanced,
but isolated technical topics.  Yet that is what we will strive to
achieve, a clear documentation of the _systems_ involved in maintaning
a Mobile Robot.

Our focus will be less on introductory tutorials for popular
technologies, however, we will have ample pointers to good resources.
Heck, there are some GREAT tutorials that we will not improve on, so
why replicate, we'll just provide a link to such resources.

I do not know much of anything about building robots.  I do have a
background in software engineering, so that is the portal I will be
viewing this project from.
