We Create Software that Moves Hardware. Mobile Robots I/O is a
software development agency that works with _Makers_, _Manufactures_,
_Industrial_ and _Environmental_ service companies.

Our approach to software development is modern and cutting edge.  Our
abilities are built on experience from the trenches and rigours
application of mathematics, when beneficial.

We are a very small company with 2.5 people and a small handleful of
reliable US contractors (designers, writers, specific tech skill), we
bring on an as needed basis.

We work with a small handfull of clients, most of our clients are
repeat or long term customers.  

We take a lot of time upfront getting know you, understanding your
business and getting excited about it.  

That allows us to deliver solutions that you will be overly joyed
with.  We typically bring fresh set of eyes, with a portfolio of
experience to table, that inevitly leads to solutions that you had not
even thought of.
