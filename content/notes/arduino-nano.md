  The Arduino Nano is a cool mini Arduino that can fit into a pretty
  small form factor, you will just have to do a bit of soldering.

I flashed the onbaord LED and I made the RGB LED change colors.  It is powered with a 
old style mini (small) USB adaptor.  

I was able to connect the Arduino Nanos to the I2C bus created for internal 
communications.  

Power can be brought in through a 5v Vin pin.
