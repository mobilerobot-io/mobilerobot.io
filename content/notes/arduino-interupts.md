Nick Gammon does a great job [describing interupts on the Arduino](http://gammon.com.au/interrupts), 
when and I why you might want to use them.  As an overly summarized version,
if you want to be able to get a notification when data has arrived
without having to sleep and poll for data.
  
Talk about Ardiuno interupts, non-blocking I/O and Nearly Real Time
OS.  This is a very good, and very indepth article.

TODO: Add some code snippets as examples for running external
engines.
