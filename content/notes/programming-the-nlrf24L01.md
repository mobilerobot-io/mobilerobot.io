This RC reciever chip is very easy to use out of the box, yet provides
some very sophisticated capabilities.  The first project We'll start
using this chip will be a remote control Joystick for our mobile
robot.

## Todos:

- point to the datasheet
- load personal photos of my project with NRF20L
  - pull the image from evernote
- fritz a diagram 
- post code that I use and or wrote
- Try to do an eagle cad
