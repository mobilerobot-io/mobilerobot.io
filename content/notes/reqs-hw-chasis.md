title: Chassis and Drive Train
description: >
  Our targeted research body is a sturdy, but inexpensive block set
  making it easily reconfigurable but sturdy (temporarily) for short
  term projects.

The body and drive train of the Robot will determine if our project is
going to actually function in the real world.  It all starts with a
design in mind, choices of materials, the design of all functional
components, mobility, motion and durability of the project.

For this project we will start with a 2 track _tank_ chasis made of "?
beam" assembly.

## Requirements ~ HW Chassis

- 2 tread _tank_ design
- customized assemblies, expandable
- modular, support _interchangable_ configurations
  - support sensors
  - support cameras
  - support batteries
  - support micro-controllers
  - support motors

### Bonus Points

- sturdy, be resilient to destructive forces
- light weight
- pre-built mechanical asseblies, levers, gears, etc.

## OSEPP 2 tread tank chassis

We are starting with the [TODO XXX tank kit] from OSEPP.  It is
inexpensive, sturdy and easy to assemble.  Most important, it can
easily be customized or expanded by buying additional beams and
components.

> Requirement 2 track tank (like osepp)

### Alternative Designs

For the sake of progress we are going to focus on the two tread tank,
however it is an fuzzy goal to develop the software (and hw) such that
it can be used on alternate designs, two wheel balance bot, tri-tank
or 3, 4 wheel vehicles.

Of course, the choice of _drive train_ will heavily influence the
required motors, navigation and guidance software.

Our application does not require, nor has much use for high speed,
rather navigating and manuevering around tight and unknown areas is
a priority.

This application is perfect for skid steering, also skid steer can be
of the simpler algorithems to implement and maintain.

At least that is our current assumption!
