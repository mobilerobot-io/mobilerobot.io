## Limitations of Hardware 

The Arduino is the workhorse of the maker world, for very good reason,
but I quickly realized I was running out of pins for all the things I
wanted to attach to Arduino.

A motorshield on one Arduino, and a large number of sensors will
overwhelm the hardware power of one of these devices.  More important,
the processing power can easily become overwhelmed with some of the
smarts required for the driving algorightms and moving time-series
data into the clowd.

For that reason we will setup a Micro/Macro Controller arrangement for
our purpose.
