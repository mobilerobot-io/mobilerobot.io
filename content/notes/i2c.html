There are some great things about I2C (or Two Wire) as you will see it
refered to.

## RealTime Communication between Arduino and RPI

I2C seems to be an ideal option for short but low delay communication messages
such as those that would be experienced in a sensor network, or perhaps a moderate 
control system.

## Wiring I2C Between RPi & Arduino

The simplest form of wiring between the RPI and an Arduino is as follows:

### Simple ~ RPI Master, arduino Slave

### Flexible ~ RPI & Arduino Logic Separated I2C

This method uses a logic level converter to create separate 3.3v and 5v i2c segments.
It uses a Voltage Divider (Logic Level Converter) to separate 3.3v segments of the clock and 
data lines.

Note, the LLC must be _bidirectional_ allowing signals to pass 
from high to low, and low to high.
