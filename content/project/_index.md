Our focus here is on _practical yet affordable_ robot applications and
the architecture that makes them possible (or not!).

Here is a quick overview of our project requirements.

- Problem Definition
- Work through the Design Requirements and Constraints
- We will explore alternative designs, measure and evaluate our choices
- Select our design elements
- Create our Detailed Design
- The detailed design will involve _experimentation_, _modeling_ and
  _analysis_ that drive our decisions. 
- Communicate the Design, after all we want to get all the
  constructive feedback that we can.
  
- Fabricate and Assemble
  - Mechanical Design and Fabrication
  - Electronics and power
  - Test and Deploy software

- Evaluate Performance
