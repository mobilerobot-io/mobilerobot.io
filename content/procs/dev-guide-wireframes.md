In some cases a wireframe will represent a single web page, in others
it will represent a _template_ which represents a repeatable layout
that can be reused for many pages by simply replacing the content.

## Use Them!

Create wireframes for clients to review aside from the stylesheet.

## Wireframes Define Layouts

The wireframe will define the layout of all pages (and window
displays) of the site or application.

## Wireframes and Stylesheets

The wireframe will dictate the HTML markup along with the html ID and
Classes.  

The stylesheet(css) determines the colors, fonts & typography.
