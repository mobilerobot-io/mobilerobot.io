## Intro

Hello, 

I am going to send a proposal for this job as a Rasperry Pi / Arduino
Programmer.  I really enjoy building and documenting Raspberry Pi
projects, and this job looks very interesting. 

But first I'd like have a more accurate understanding of the scope of
the project: for example what size are the projects?  Are they
beginer tutorials for training or more sophisticated projects
requiring a more formalized engineering process?

## About Me

I am a career softwre engineer, with decades of roadware building
software, specifically targeted at embedded systems, networking.

Here is a pointer to a recent Arduino project.  It involves a mobile
camera, OpenCV, face recognition and driving an electric DC motor.

## About Us :)

I would also like to mention that I work closely with a grizzled old
Electrical Engineer and vetted project manner, who is also quite handy
slinging code.

I wanted to mention that in the event you had projects that required
expertise from both a software and hardware perspective.

> ## Call to Action:

Are these projects intended to be used for training or instructionals,
by chance?

Cheers, 

- Rusty Eddy
