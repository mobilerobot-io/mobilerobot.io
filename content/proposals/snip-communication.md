All successful software and hardware projects begin with efficient
communication, with A clearly established goals and objectives.  I
spend a significant amount of my time understanding your the
objectives of your project, and a bit about your business when
warrented. (I love learning about interesting businesses).

A bit of extra work upfront will speed actual development time. And
significantly increase success factors.
