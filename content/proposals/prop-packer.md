Hi Paul, 

# Your Job is Right up My Alley

I am very interested in your job posting. First, I have been working
with pretty much every technology you mention for the 5+ years.

Specifically, I have developed and managed numerous WP websites (still
manage a couple today.)  I use Vagrant, Digital Ocean (and others),
*everyday*.

## My Opinion on "The best Provisioner"

> Before, I go on, my preferred "provisioner" is **Ansible** hands
> down. (though I categorize it as a config management) (I know
> vagrant calls them provisioners), I would classify something like
> *Terraform* as a "provisioner".

But I won't squabble over a few quid..

## My (Very Similar) Project

I am literally working on my own project, *this week* that is almost
exactly what you want to learn.  (My project is to help track websites
that I manage).

I am using Vagrant, Terraform, Ansible to "spin up" development and
production websites, and production infrastructure.  I will be adding
Packer to the mix shortly. 

## Check Out What I Have So Far

You can see exactly what I have done, and what my current plans are on
this website http://clowdops.net (does not exist, but will be up this
evening).

The entire repository, including CI/CD scripts to automatically deploy
changes committed to git are all included in the Github repository.

Please, have a look at the first repo is the website that will be
launched, the second repo provisions the infra-structure, then launches
the website.

  - http://github.com/mobilerobot-io/otto

This evening the following URL (not currently active) website will be
available this evening.  The site will describe exactly how the entire
automation process works.

> know if you are interested in having a look, I will add you as a
> collaborator. 

## About Me

I have been programming professionally for over 3 decades. I have
always stayed up to date.  These days, I use the tools you mention
about daily, for real work that I get paid for.  (I know them well).

### Teaching

I love to teach.  I have lead, litterally hundreds of Jr. Engineers
over the years, I still hear from folks I've mentored years ago.

> I have also taught undergraduate Computer Science classes at USC (in
> case you want to get hardcore :)

### I am Just Starting on Upwork

Although, I am just getting started on Upwork,  I have been running my
own adjency since 2006.  If you are considering programming
professionally, I have a few nuggets of wisdom I can drop along your
way. 

I also, would be eternally greatful for an honest review, for which I
will happily work for at an incredibly affordable introductory
price. :)


### In Conclusion

This is exciting stuff!  There are a lot of cool things
happening with web development right now and into the foresable
future, however, I know it can be a little overwhemling getting
started and staying focused. 

I have both of those areas covered!

Regardless of who you hire, I am happy to answer any questions you
have. 

Cheers, 

Rusty Eddy
