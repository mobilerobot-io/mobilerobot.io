The process to sending in proposals on **Upwork** specifically, is a
little different that what it might seem like it should be.

The *proposal* is really the first chance you have to discuss a
project with the prospect.  That makes it nearly impossible to put an
accurate bid together to send to the client, espcially when you do not
know all the details.

> The Uplink Proposal is really to start a conversation with the
> prospect, not something we can confidently give a firm commitment
> to. 

### Read there Job Offering

We must assure the client that we have read, understand and are quite
capable of delivering the project.  On time, budget, etc.

### Sentence 1 ~ Capture the clients attention

The client will only see the first line of our proposal response.  The
rest of the response will be hidden until they client a *more* button
to read more.

If the first sentence does not capture their attention and make them
want to read more, they wont.

The first sentence needs to capture that attention and make them want
to client on to read paragraph1.

### Paragraph 1: Gets them Wanting to Work With Us

Again we need to establish in the clients mind that we have carefully
read their job listing, understand it and are very capable of
completing the job.

We need to establish immediately that we are easy (and efficient) to
communicate with and hopefully, even enjoyable to work with.

### Paragraph 2: Demonstrates We can Complete the Job

This paragraph typically will point to one or two (three max) specific
portfolio pieces that establish our skills at performing the tasks
that we have bid on.

### Paragraph 3: Establishes Our Credibility

If they have got this far, we can NOW establish our credibility.  Our
Resume, Degrees, certifications, publications, and other ego stuff.

### Call To Action

Try to get a ***response*** from the prospect.  We do not need to
close the deal in the proposal.  Just get the conversation started.

Once the conversation has started, the immediate goal is to establish
exactly the scope and **intention** of the prospect.

#### Do NOT be too agressive

We are NOT sales people.  We are problem solvers, ask them simple
questions to clearify points of the job listing and project
logistics. 

Things like:

> Is the project milestone a proof of concept or is the project
> immediately headed for production?

Let them know you are available for a followup, if they are interested.
