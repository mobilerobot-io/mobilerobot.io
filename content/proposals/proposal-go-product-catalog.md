Hello, 

I read your job listing regarding a Go programmer to help with your
project to scrape the football betting website, which is very
interesting me.

I have recently developed a library package called "store" that
provides a simple CRUD api to save Go objects as JSON objects on a
filesystem, in a database (MongoDB) or cloud bucket.

A version of this program can be seen in the project:
https://github.com/rustyeddy/store

I am working on a project (Go server) that will provide network
performance dashboards to display asynchronous updates using Go
templates, which, I believe would be a perfect usage for you product
catalog.

I have been programming with Go almost exclusively for the last 2
years.  Additionally I have been developing software for a little more
than three decades.

I specialize in distributed systems, micro-services, network
programming and cloud automation.

Regarding my work history, I have been employed for about 15 years by
large technical companies like: McDonnell Douglas, Cisco System,
DirecTV and AT&T, where I have been a Principal Engineer, Technical
Lead, Senior Systems Developer, and Member of The Technical Staff.

I have also, worked at 5 start-up and run my own successful consulting
firm since 2006.

I have lead, designed and contributed to many success production
systems and products.  Includes:

- Guidance and Navigation Flight control software
- Cisco System Core Routing System
- DirecTV revamp of multicast video delivery network
- AT&T Zero touch provisioning system
- First OpenSource / production implementation of the PIM Sparse Mode
  multicast routing protocol.

By the way, you most likely noticed that I am new on Upwork, looking
to get my first feedback, for this I am prepared to do a great job.  I
will also honor a low lifetime rates for my first three clients.
