Hello, 

I got excited when I read your job posting, I have been working with
sensor networks, and collecting timeseries data for quite a few years,
on ongoing project with a long term client. And again, more
recently with networks of Raspbetty Pi's. and Arduinos. 

I have read your proposal a couple times, though I do have a couple
questions, I believe I have a good understanding of what you are
after. 

I can readily cover the following tasks.

1. Sensor /Pin control, data gathering and transmission
2. GUI, realtime updates, sounds like a job for websocket
3. Light weight timeseries data base and injestment pipeline
4. Cloud storage, retrieval, archiving, indexing, etc.
5. Software Engineering and Development.

I have No Alexa expirence, but 100% will to make it happen.

Second I work with a Colleage, that has is an EE and experienced with
hardware, power, fabrication and bringing physical products to market.

We are both new to Upwork, hence the lack of reviews, that being the
case we are willing to work for a bargain, in exchange for an Honest
review. 

I assure you, we will work hard to make this project a success and
earn a solid reputation.

As I mentioned, I do have a couple questions, mostly about the
physical design, you mentioned the GUI separate from the RPi, is this
a single RPi with all 10 sensors, proximity, power and communication
options.
