Hello, 

I read your job listing regarding a Go programmer to help with your
{{ .GoProject }}, which is very interesting to me.

I have recently worked on a {{ .SimilarProject }} where I implemented
a {{ .Feature1 }} and {{ .Feature2 }}.  If you are interested please
have a look at my portfolio here: {{ .Portfolio1 }}.

On a related note, I have also worked with {{ .Interest }} to
accomplish {{ .Goal }} on this project: {{ .Portfolio2 }}.

I have been programming with Go almost exclusively for the last 2
years.  Additionally I have been developing software for a little more
than three decades.

I specialize in distributed systems, micro-services, network
programming and cloud auotamtion.

Regarding my work history, I have been employeed for about 15 years by
large technical companies like: McDonnel Douglas, Cisco System,
DirecTV and AT&T, where I have been a Prinicapal Engineer, Technical
Lead, Senior Systems Developer, and Member of The Technical Staff.

I have also, worked at 5 start-up and run my own successful consulting
firm since 2006. 

I have lead, designed and contributed to many success production
systems and products.  Includes:

- Guidance and Navigation Flight control software
- Cisco System Core Routing System
- DirecTV revamp of multicast video delivery network
- AT&T Zero touch provisioning system

  multicast routing protocol.

By the way, you most likely noticed that I am new on Upwork, looking
to get my first feedback, for this I am prepared to do a great job.  I
will also honor a low lifetime rates for my first three clients.
