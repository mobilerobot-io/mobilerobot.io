description: 10 water sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi
proposal: draft
---

Hello, I got excited when I read your job posting, I have been working
with sensor networks, collecting timeseries data for quite a few years,
mostly through on ongoing project with a long term client, Sierra
Hydrographics. 

And again, more recently with networks and RPi's. and Arduinos.

Parts of the project I have covered:

1. Programming, 35 years, pick a language ...
2. GUI, realtime updates, sounds like a job for websocket
3. Light weight timeseries data base and injestment pipeline
4. Cloud storage, retrieval, archiving, indexing, etc.

I have not done any voice activated Alexa, 

clarification

1. Do you want all 10 sensors running to a single Raspberry Pi?
   2. You mention that cables must be quite a few feet, are these cables
	  for the sensors?
   3. How far from the RPi do the sensors need to be?
   
2. Separate housing for RPi & GUI ~ Is the GUI on an RPI, or can it be
   any old computer or phone?
   2. Is the GUI an lcd on an RPI
   3. Distance between RPI and GUI?
