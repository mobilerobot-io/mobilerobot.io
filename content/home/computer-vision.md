As it turns out, computer vision is the primary sensor used by robots
to drive.  Many other methods are avaliable, and quite effective given
the appropriate application.

## Follow the Lines

For example robots that are part of an automated CNC manufacturing
system may operate perfectly fine by following colored lines on the
floor, but a vehical that drives on the streets, or one that drives in
"uncharted territory" does not have the luxury of pre-painted lines.

## GPS, Maps and Way Points

A comprehensive map of an area can be very useful for many driving
schemes, in the same manner it is essential for all of us driving from
one location to another.

Even with perfectly mapped routes, an automated vehicle obviously
needs additional inputs to deal with non-static issues, like people
walking out into the street, crazy drivers and falling bridges.

So, additional forms of inputs are required.

## Sensors and Sensor Networks

Sensors are an invaluable tool for lots of reasons including building
and operating autounomous vehicles. For example, a temprature and
moisture sensor attached to a vehicle can provide very valuable
information in real time.
