Processors and electronics in general have dropped in price to such an
extent that virtually anybody that can afford a cell phone can begin
to work on any one of millions of ideas or projects, robots being just
one example.

## OpenSource Wins!

Finally, after 3 decades of battling backward minded people in charge,
OpenSource software has finally become the norm.  

Of course the amount of money saved by using open source software is
significant, and sometimes even _HUGE_, but we have one much more
important reason OpenSource is critical is the _Freedom_.

The Freedom to stand on the shoulders of Giants and build upone what
they have done, just by putting in some effort and intuition.  Freedom
to copy your own work at will, where ever you want to, whenever you
want.

Nobody can stop you, or charge you additional licenses or make you
store long untypable God forsaken software licensing keys.

Now, an entire populace of people that would have never been admitted
or hired by one of these precious few institutional opportunities.

Now, we can order online $100 worth of electronics and all the free
worl class software you can wrap your mind around sits here TODAY
waiting for us to Go Forth and Create!
