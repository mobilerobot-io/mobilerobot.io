Robots are by definition are mechanical, and hence require a
significant knowledge of both Mechanical Engineering, Materials
Science and good old fasion _Farmers Knowledge_.

Mechanics are a concenrn for a number of reasons:

1. What should we use? we need to be concerned about, weight,
   strength and cost.  But we also need to consider how easy or
   difficult is it to customize, manipulate and maintain...
2. Design of moving, mechanical parts.  Wheels, articulating arms and
   drive chasiss are just a couple examples.
3. Develop a design that is modular and easy to configure and
   reconfigure.  Clips and connectors must be easy to access, durable
   and easy to operate.
