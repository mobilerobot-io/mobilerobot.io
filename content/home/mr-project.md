We are going to attempt to build a robot that will film the underside
of my house, as well as collect some sensor data like heat and
moisture. 

A major goal will be building a self navigating vehicle, although
human override will be available.  The most valuable input for self
navigating vehicals is computer vision, hence we will also spend a
considerable amount of time with the vision subsystem.
