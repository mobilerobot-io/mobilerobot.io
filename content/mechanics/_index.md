  Our first robot is _Tank_, I should say _a tank_ made of OSEPP
  X-Beam, though any similar gear can come to the party!

The chasis is from OSEPP [_Tank Mechanical
Kit_](https://osepp.com/robotic-kits/4-tank-mechanical-kit) which
provides the tank hardware including the wheels and tracks, a bunch of
I beams and some platforms.

## Twin 9v DC Motors

The tank is powered by two 9v DC Motors running at a 1:45 (slow and
powerful) gear ratio.
