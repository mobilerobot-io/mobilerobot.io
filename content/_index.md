  Is a project to develop a self navigating vehicles for under 100 bucs,
  and learn about Robotics along the way.

This is an ambitious project for a number of reasons: aside from the fact
that Robotics involves a serious level of expertise in many topics,
beginning with (but certainly not limited to) Mechanical and
Electrical Engineering, Software Architecture and Communication
Networks, Materials science, AI, Computer Vision and Audio, ..

It is also moderately ambitious in that our target vehical much cost
less than $100 USD.  Which, being totaly honest is very doable these
days (yaeh!)

But what REAALLy makes this ambiotous, is that I am starting out with
nearly zero knowledge of _real_ robotics.  So this _project_ is really
a learning experience, that I intend to document for future reference.

## Beyond A Toy Story

One key driver is that we will attempt to come up with applications
beyond "toys" or "games", rather some what of a practical function.

Like battlebots, for example, it is a VERY practical application of R
A Beautiful like battle bots in my opinion a very practical
application of robotics.


## About The Tank Project

As previously mentioned, there are many disciplines that must come
together to make this project successful, below I have attempted to
create some high level topics that drill down into requirements,
experiments and trade offs.

Ready to build a Robot?  Jump into your choosen area of interest.  But
first maybe you want a high level overview of how everything is
envisioned to come together, have a look at the Tank.
