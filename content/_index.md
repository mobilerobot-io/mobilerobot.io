Building a useful Robot is hard, in large part because Robotics is an
inter-disciplinary subject matter requiring a high level of mastery of
a number of complex subjects, (some of which we have listed below).

What makes makes this project even more challenging is that we are not
_Roboticists_ nor are experts at very many of the fields we are going
to need to master (or find somebody that has) these topics to make
this project a success.
