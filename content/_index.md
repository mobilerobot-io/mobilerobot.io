This website is about the Mobile Robot Project: the discovery of
available technologies pertinant to building an affordable mobile
video camera, the engineering process used to develop  a production
ready, industrial strength vehical.  I will, of course include my own
implementation of these finding, right here in this website.

The potential applications for such a robot are endless, and it is
easy for me to get carried away with all the cool and useful things
this _Robot_ can do, and stay focused on delivering the promise.

### Interesting but Overwhelming

One thing quickly became obvious is that a working Robot, *any*
working Robot is a network of multi-disciplinary connection
_compromises_.

To the end of minimizing _overwhelm_ and keeping the interest factor
high, we are going to set out a series of _project goals_ that will
help us stay focused on an end objective, evaluate our current
activities (to avoid rabbit trails) and finally gain a sense of
satisfaction and accomplishment when we hit our goals.

## Evolving Project

I would like to know that this project is not a one in done deal, Nor
is it one specific Solution to the seated project goals, rather I am
looking to Establish a set of best practices being applied to building
Affordable robotic projects.

My ultimate goal will be achieved Is this website is to become a
useful resource For serious hobbyist professionals alike.

### Project Goals

The first two _high level_ goals for this project are:

#### Goal 1 ~ Computer and Human Controlled

Our vehical will can be controlled by either a human with a remote
control, or by a _control algorigthm_ running on, one of the vehicles
MCUs. 

The control method must be selectable at runtime, in other words, a
human operator will be able to switch the vehicles primary control
between computer algorightm and webapp for example.

#### Goal 2 ~ Stream Live Video and Sensor Data

The vehicle when supplied with the appropriate equipment Is required
to stream the corresponding data back Control station, That may be
monitored by a human.

To require datatypes That must be streamed back to the control station
are Live streaming video As well as sensor data Such as temperature
moisture etc.
