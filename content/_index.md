<<<<<<< HEAD
This website documents the progress of learning how to build a Mobile
Robot. This site captures a lot of technical details, and a myriad of
things I have learned during my process of doing Proof Of Concepts,
building prototype robots and trying to get production ready.
=======
This website is about the Mobile Robot Project: the discovery of
available technologies pertinant to building an affordable mobile
video camera, the engineering process used to develop  a production
ready, industrial strength vehical.  I will, of course include my own
implementation of these finding, right here in this website.

The end goal is to build an industrial strength _mobile rover with a
video camera_ ready for production environments.  the discovery of
available technologies pertinant to building and afforable mobile
vehicle, the engineering process necessary to develop an industrial
strength device.  And of course, our own implementation of said Robot.
