This website documents the progress of learning how to build a Mobile
Robot. This site captures a lot of technical details, a myriad of
things I learned during my Proof Of Concept, as well as the many
versions of Robots I have built, contributed to and found
interesting.

The end goal is to build an industrial strength _mobile rover with a
video camera_ ready for production environments.  the discovery of
available technologies pertinant to building and afforable mobile
vehicle, the engineering process necessary to develop an industrial
strength device.  And of course, our own implementation of said Robot.
