This is an ambitious project in that it requires a moderately high
level of skill in many disciplines including mechanics, electronics,
software, mobility, networking and communications.

What makes it even more ambitous is that I am **NOT** an expert, nor
even very knowledgable in any of these disciplines, expect for a
certain (questionable) level of proficiency in software. 

## Software Makes Hardware Live

This project does bring me back to the days of working on _embedded
systems_ and _Real Time Operating System (RTOS)_, a magic time when,
only after hours of toil and frustration, do you load one more
iteration of your program and BAM ...

> !!!! She's ALIVE !!!!

Your software just made hardware *do something*, FINALLY!!!  An LED
started blinking, a disk whiring, an ethernet port blinking or a robot
tank start driving around in a square (not a circle!).

What a thrill to take a completely abstract thought, from your brain
and turn it into a _living_ functioning hunk of hardware!  I can't
think of many others, except for excaping one of mother nature's large
heaving barrel (a surf reference).

### Beyond A Tutorial

We are going to design, build and test software that goes well beyond
a "beginners tutorial" on making an arduino spin a tire or something.
We are going to build an automous driving vehicle!  This is the real
shit! 

We are going to understand topics like:

- Asynchronous Programming makes a fluid robot
- Concurrent vs. Parallel programming, more is faster, sometimes!
- Efficient memory usage, use it wisely child, ain't much to go around
- Embedded Systems and efficient energy, don't spend it in one place
- Mobile devices and Real Time communications
- Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) ...

## Software Gives Life to Hardware

Mechanics is one of the pillar skills of robots, with everything to do
with structure and support, motion with levers and gears, driven by
motors. Safety, cost, size, materials and weight are all challenges
that are going to be met on the mechanical front.

I am just as excited about the mechanics of the robot project!  I grew
up in a house with a garage full of tools, car, bike and motorcycle
parts.  (I was the first "white color" person in my family (I'm still
the only)).

However, pretty much everybody else in my immediate and extended "blue
color" family I grew up, where mechanics (cars, CNC machines, convyer
belts, dragsters and longshore cranes).

So, getting back in the garage, litterally takes me back home, to a
time, long long ago when tools where used to build skateboards and fix
broken bikes.



This project is ambitious because it is necessary to lean on expert
skills in the areas of mechanics, electronics, motors, batteries,
sensors and cameras, gears, levers and control software.

Whew. that is a lot.
