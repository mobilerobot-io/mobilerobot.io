This is an ambitious project in that it requires a moderately high
level of skill in many disciplines including mechanics, electronics,
software, mobility, networking and communications.

What makes it even more ambitous is that I am **NOT** an expert, nor
even very knowledgable in any of these disciplines, expect for a
certain (questionable) level of proficiency in software. 

## About The Tank Project

As previously mentioned, there are many disciplines that must come
together to make this project successful, below I have attempted to
create some high level topics that drill down into requirements,
experiments and trade offs.

Ready to build a Robot?  Jump into your choosen area of interest.  But
first maybe you want a high level overview of how everything is
envisioned to come together, have a look at the Tank.
