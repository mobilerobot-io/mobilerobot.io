This is an ambitious project in that it requires a moderately high
level of skill in many disciplines including mechanics, electronics,
software, mobility, networking and communications.

What makes it even more ambitous is that I am **NOT** an expert, nor
even very knowledgable in any of these disciplines, expect for a
certain (questionable) level of proficiency in software. 

Below, I have created independant sections that discuss some of the
challenges and decisions that are going to be necessary in building
our robot.  Let's jump in and start building a Robot!
