This website documents the progress of learning how to build a Mobile
Robot. This site captures a lot of technical details, and a myriad of
things I have learned during my process of doing Proof Of Concepts,
building prototype robots and trying to get production ready.

The end goal is to build an industrial strength _mobile rover with a
video camera_ ready for production environments.  the discovery of
available technologies pertinant to building and afforable mobile
vehicle, the engineering process necessary to develop an industrial
strength device.  And of course, our own implementation of said Robot.
