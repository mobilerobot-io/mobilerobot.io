This is an ambitious project for a number of reasons: first Robotics
is a intricate multi-disceplinary disciplines (mechanics, electronics,
software, power, sight, sound, and so much more.) 

But this is particularly ambitious since I do not know a thing about
Robotics and very little about the various discplines required to
build even the most simple robot.

Everybody starts at the beginning, right?

>participate?  I would love to have your help!


## What will we work on?

My first thoughts when I hear The word robot is to conjure up an image
of a science fiction movie or something amazing that NASA or Boston
dynamics is been working on. But I certainly don't have the budget nor
the space in my garage toBuild anything like that when aloneSheer lack
of knowledge.

And that has limited my involvement in Robotics.. Until now, a
combination of OpenSource HW & SW.

> Affordable AND practical robots.

## Project Overview

To learn this stuff we are going to start building and reading in
between, since after all, there is no better way to learn.
