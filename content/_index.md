Building  a useful Robot is hard, in large part because robots require
mastery of many subjects including but not limited to mechanics,
materials, electronics and power.  Modern robots are heavily dependent
on software and communications.

Obtaining mastery in one of these areas is a significan undertaking
anything more than that is the land of unicorns!

I do not know much of anything about building robots.  I do have a
background in software engineering, so that is the portal I will be
viewing this project from.

## Phase 1 ~ Mobile Robot

The first phase of this project will be to build a _remote control
mobile vehicle_ consisting of one or more wheels or tank tracks. 

The vehicle must be controlled controlled by each of the following

1. a computer program
- keyboard control
- joystick control

### The Chasis

Here we need to select a Chasis that will be capable of manuevering,
housing and protecting the electronics and batteries. 

1. 4wd, 2wd or Track
- Skid Steering

### Micro-Controller and Motors

Raspberry Pi or Arduino?  And which motor controller should we use?
