We want to build an automous driven vehicle that can film and stream
video from under my house, for under USD $500.  The vehical must also
be able to communicate select sensor data.
 <!--more-->
 
The vehical must be modular and allow some degree of configurability,
both hardware and software. Another critical feature is the vehicals
ability to communicate with a local _controllor_ and either directly
or indirectly to either a _Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)_ or the
Internet. 

## Project Requirements 

1. Vehical must be able to navigate in new and automous territories. 
2. Vehical must be able to film and save and/or stream video real time
3. Vehical must be able to switch arbitrarily between autonomous and
   controlled modes
4. Software must be able to control a variety of drive systems
   including _tank tracks_, 2 and wheel vehicals for start.
7. vehical must be provide a configurable design, hardware and
   software 
8. Vehical must be able to support sensors including: temprature,
   moisture, and others.
9. cameras must be PTZ.
10. Distance sensors, area mapping are all possible

### Constraints

4. Vehical must be able to operate with no connected cables
5. Vehical must be able to modify and update software during
   production with minimal to no down time.
6. Vehical must operate from battery

We will discuss each of these issues in greater detail in there
respective sections.
