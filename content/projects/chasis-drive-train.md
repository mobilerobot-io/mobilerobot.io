  At first it seemed simple, just pick one of the cool under $100
  robot kits and get going.  But it is not so simple after all...
todo: 
  - place an images of all vehicles
  - place links to all kits
  - design a rover body with plenty of room for electronics
  - learn Fusion360 and Eagle Cad

It has hit me in very clear term, It has occured to me how big 
of a challenge it is to create the mechanical housing,
with all the cooling, cable management, room for power,
be modular and easy to maintian.

Oh yea, all the while maintaining the optimized motors, 
suspension, steering and drive train.

Well here we go.  It first started to occur to me after 
I built the first robot vehical "kit" when I routed a 
few wires incorrectly, then wanted to add a couple more
components.

Things fell off, wires got ran over I then began to realise
the importance of suspension and how _non-trivial_ steering
schemes are.

But most important of all the above.  It MUST look COOL!

## OH, That is Why Great Design is So Hard

It has finally occurred to me how important and HARD good
design is.  

> Great designers are Unicorns!

OK I get it.  Time to start meeting some great designers
and learning what elements make up great designs.
