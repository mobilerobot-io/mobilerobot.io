This project, the control system will determine how easy or difficult it will
be to integrate various controls both human and automated.  

## Problem Definition

The robot must be controllable by a variety of methods that include both human
and computer controls.  To accomplish this goal, it is essential that the
software is developed as modular and inter-conencted.

### Requirements 

Our drive system must be able to adapt to various steering algorithms
including _skid_, _Ackerman_ and _Rear Assisted_ stearing.

In addition to supporting a variety of drive trains, it is also necessary to
support different drive algorithms, guided by various sensor data, including
but not limited variety of sensor data and camera images, proximity sensros
and so on.
