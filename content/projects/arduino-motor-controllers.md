The code in this library can be compiled by with the 
[Arduino IDE](http://arduino.io/downloads) to an UNO with an Adafrutit
v.2 (or compatible) motor controller.  One of the MBR vehicles OSEPP
Two Wheel balancer uses an OSEPP motor library wich is very similar
(but) different than the Adafruit version.

I have also used, and own some of the early v1 style motorshields from
Adafruit.  Outdated, yes, but still very useful and easy to use.  We
will make good use of these OG motor controllers for sure!
