As it turns out building a Robot is complicated, one of the many
challenges of building a _working_ robot is achieving a satisfactory
level of many full time disciplines, including but not limited to:
mechanics and materials, electronics and power, software and
communication, these are just high level disciplines, each of these
categories involves many specialties.

## A Little Help From My Friends

At the end of the day, it is most likely too ambitious a task to build
one of the worlds finest, affordable, OpenSource robots all on my
own.  The end product will require relying on many others, through
Open Source sofware and hardware, information available on Youtube,
and even best of all, meeting people face to face that share a passion
and skills for building Robots.

I certainly need help, both learning what it will take to build
this robot, but better, maybe get some helping hands to chip in and
make this project fabulous!

Is there something on this site you would like to see, or a particular
interest you happen to have?
