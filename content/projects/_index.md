The Mobile Robot I/O Project is more than a single project, really it
is a group of projects related to building, running and maintaining a
mobile robot.

This is an ambitious project to be sure, first because _robots_ are
complex animals requiring a level of mastery over complext topics
subjects such as Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, Software and
Communication Architecture and even websites and servers.

It is especially a challenge since we are NOT experts at any (well
maybe a couple) of the topics required to build a Robot or self
driving vehicle.
