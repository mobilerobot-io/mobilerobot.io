The Mobile Robot I/O project is really a collection of very different
projects all coming together to make a specification of building _self
driving robots_. 
<!--more-->

I am starting this _not knowing what I don't know_, I know that.  At
this point to get our basic bot rollin, here are the major projects
going on now.  

### Mechanical

I was surprised out how quickly _mechanics_ became an issue, before
building a bot, you need to really think through not just tracks
vs. wheels, ignore turning and suspension.  Also, how to neatly mount
all the perhiphs and Keep wires from becoming a mess.

### Electrical

The electrical, is what attracted me, initially.  Not a subject I knew
much about, but electronics makes magic happen, it causes the _real
world_ mechanics to come alive!  These days, with the low pricess of
very powerful hardware, and the Open-ness of software, there are
truley endless possibilities.

### Software Rules

The electronics are awesome, the mechanics amazing, but software is
what puts the ___smart___ in _normal and boring objects_ like, phones,
cars and doorbells.  Software is a topics I know quite a thing or two
about, let us see how we can jump in and start creating some robots.
