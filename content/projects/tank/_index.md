*Open Tank* is a project to build an autonmous driving vehicle that
can roam under your house, around the garden, or other "out of the
way" places telling you about what it finds.

We want to be able to find leaks under our house, insideous spores in
our garden or annoy a cat.  Here we have a set of requirements for our
mobile robot.
