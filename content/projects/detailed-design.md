We will use a Raspberry Pi as the main on unit controller.  The
Raspberry Pi will be attached via one of the common local bus
protocols (i2c, SPI or Canbus).  Read More ...
<!--more-->

One Arduino will be dedicated to motor controls, one or more
additional arduino's maybe used

## Controller

## Experimentation and PoC

I2C Experiements, SPI & others

## Modeling

Can we create a software modeling for our physical vehical?

## Analysis and Selection

Establish a true selection criteria built from experimental evidence
toward the superior designs.
