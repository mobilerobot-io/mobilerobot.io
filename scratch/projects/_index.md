Robotics is inter-disciplinary, for me that is one of it's most intreging(sp)
aspects, you have to get a lot of things right to get a Minimum Viable Robot
(MVR).

This project primary goal, a _self driving videographer_ is still a long ways
away from an MVP, which is really a collection of different projects all coming
together to make a specification of building _self driving robots_.

The current state of the project is that we have built the _kits_ and got them 
working, now the work in primarily going into separating, what I am calling
the _application_ code from the _control code_.

We are also working with very basic chasis, either wheel or tank tranks, with
rather compact chassis.  We will have to step up the chasis size to accomadate
more electronics, gizmo attachments and batteries to supply ample power.
