Different options for powering robots.  Stationary, near electrical outlets
is always the easiest, but does not bode well for _mobile_ and _autonomous_.

Batteries are the key factor.

Make a list of my various power supplies. 

Also make a link to the Youtube video that shows how to make a multi voltage
power supply from an old PC power supply.
