<p>This website was created to track the Mobile Robot Project, which is
to build a robot for under $500.  While this project is about building
an actual real world Robotic Vehicle, it is not about doing it in one
specific way.</p>

<p>I intend to document a variety of design trade-offs as we come across
them.  It is my hope that the documents and other resources that I
stumble across are going to be of help, perhaps for a different
application or perhaps to understand the reasoning behind the choice
we do make.</p>

<h2 id="shoulders-of-giants">Shoulders of Giants</h2>

<p>At this point, early in The development of the robotic project, I
really don&rsquo;t know what alternatives are available, Nor do I have an
understanding of previous or existing works.</p>

<p>So there is no doubt that I am going to begin to reinvent the wheel in
the number of cases, But during that process discover the principal
challenges in developing a particular application.</p>

<p>In the process of doing so I expect they will run acrossGreat pieces
of software that Will laterUsing and perhaps scrapping a lot of what
we write and create.</p>

<p>Anyway favor you&rsquo;re interest in this project and I hope you will
follow along, And perhapsSign up to keep up with what we&rsquo;re doing or
better yet maybe chick didn&rsquo;t contribute some good stuff.</p>

<p>Building  a useful Robot is hard, in large part because robots require
mastery of many subjects including but not limited to mechanics,
materials, electronics and power, software and communications.
Combine that with the fact that I am not a <em>Robotisicst</em>, hence
approach this project with ignorance, and preconcived ideas.</p>

<p>Without question this project is going to be about discovery.  We have
started taking on mini projects beyond the introductory and trivial.</p>

<p>Introductory material for virtually every aspect and technology that
will be used on the mobile robot project Can be readily found on the
Internet.</p>

<p>However, Finding material thatGoes beyond the introduction to a more
systematic development ofA real world projectBecomes trickier to find,
With a very good reason Hey well-built real-world systemIs difficult
to do.</p>

<p>That is precisely what a robotic vehicle is</p>

<p>While it is easy to find introductory material for pretty much every
technology we use or look at on this project will have plenti</p>

<p>Obtaining mastery in one of these areas is a significan undertaking
anything more than that is the land of unicorns!</p>

<p>I do not know much of anything about building robots.  I do have a
background in software engineering, so that is the portal I will be
viewing this project from.</p>
