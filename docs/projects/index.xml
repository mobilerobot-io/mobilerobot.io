      <description>Problem Definition When setting out to create a Mobile Robot one is faced with a lot of choices, like how does the robot steer or control itself? Does it have, legs, wheels or tracks? How will it be controlled, through computer vision, distance sensors or humans?
What Platform and Language? You are also have to ask the question, what platform will all this run on? Arduino for the sharper hardware support or the raspberry pi and it&amp;rsquo;s superior computing capabilities and software support?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first bought the Tank constructor kit from OSEPP to build my first robot
frame, it was cool, modular building blocks with a Tank Tread and two
DC motors that sat opposite of each other, generating the movement for
this vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Vehicle Communication</title>

      <description>One of the first issues that we came against was the specific configurations of the micro-controllers as well and the number and configuration of pins and hardware particulars.
Macro-Micro Controllers The system should be flexible enough to allow one or more macro-controls communicating with one or more micro-controllers.
Communication Mechanism We have a rather complex set of communication requirements, we have signals between sensors, motors and micro-controllers. We also have the communication from the micro-controllers and the macro-controller.</description>
