      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first couple &lt;em&gt;mobile robot&lt;/em&gt; kits I played with where really
awesome, but after an hour of playing with the &amp;ldquo;demo&amp;rdquo; programs, as
amazing as they were got boring pretty quick.  After all, how many
things can you do with a little car that races around a line,
or wander through a shoe box maze and avoid collisions with walls.
Want more from a robot?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first bought the Tank constructor kit from OSEPP to build my first robot
frame, it was cool, modular building blocks with a Tank Tread and two
DC motors that sat opposite of each other, generating the movement for
this vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Vehicle Communication</title>

      <description>One of the first issues that we came against was the specific configurations of the micro-controllers as well and the number and configuration of pins and hardware particulars.
Macro-Micro Controllers The system should be flexible enough to allow one or more macro-controls communicating with one or more micro-controllers.
Communication Mechanism We have a rather complex set of communication requirements, we have signals between sensors, motors and micro-controllers. We also have the communication from the micro-controllers and the macro-controller.</description>
