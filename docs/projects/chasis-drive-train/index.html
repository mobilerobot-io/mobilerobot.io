		At first it seemed simple, just pick one of the cool under $100 robot kits and get going.  But it is not so simple after all...

        <div class="col-8"><p>I first bought the Tank constructor kit from OSEPP to build my first robot
frame, it was cool, modular building blocks with a Tank Tread and two
DC motors that sat opposite of each other, generating the movement for
this vehicle.</p>

<p>The first kit I bought from OSEPP was a Tank Tread vehical,
electronics where sold seperately, but could be purchased in a kit.  I
am not so interested in the kit, as I am in learning what it takes to
build a robot.</p>

<h2 id="demo-software">Demo Software</h2>

<p>I loaded and ran a couple of the pieces of demo software, they were
pretty neat to watch, but once the novelty wore off you end up with a
rather expensive and kinda boring toy.</p>

<p>The Robot could be <em>driven</em> by any of the following configuraitons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Line tracking - follow a black line on the ground</li>
<li>Follow light with an IR sensor</li>
<li>Maze with a ping sensor</li>
<li>Human controlled over Blue Tooth</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reconfig-hardware-rewrite-software">Reconfig Hardware, Rewrite Software</h3>

<p>Every demo required a hardware reconfiguration, and a completely
different piece of software to be loaded.  Changing control
algorigthms requires the bot to be completely shutdown, hardware
re-configured and new software loaded.</p>

<p>This is required for two reasons, the project was developed with a
single Arduino and a sensor or two depending on the demo application.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-the-toy">Beyond The Toy</h3>

<p>The quest now is to build something &ldquo;useful&rdquo;, by some definition of
useful.  It became clear to me, To create something useful Is going to
require a more sophisticated and modular software design.</p>

<h3 id="different-drive-trains">Different Drive Trains</h3>

<p>And as Will see you later, I am in the purchasing a couple more
Hardware kitsThat involve a two wheel balancing robotAs well as a
four-wheel-drive robot, and a little two wheel skidder.</p>

<p>It became clear, that I could not settle on a single power train
system, tracks, two wheels, four wheels, let alone something sexier
and more exotic like Mechanum (spelling on this?) wheels.</p>

<p>Hence, the requirement of our GNC software will allow modular support
for a variety of mechanical steering mechanisms.  Of course, certain
steering algorithms can only work on particular steering controls.</p>
