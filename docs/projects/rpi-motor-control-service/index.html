<p>TODO ~ replace image with one of the Raspberry Pi Controller</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This software adds a Skid Steer motor control software to the
<a href="http://github.com/mobilerobot-io/rpid">Raspberry Pi Device Server</a>
device server.  RPID adds motor controls accessible via both MQTT and
REST APIs, as well as directly with the Skidder python library.</p>

<p>This project was to build a simple automous driving vehical using a
Raspberry Pi and a simple DC motor controller.  That is a single RPi
will act as the macro controller that manages communications and makes
control decisions.</p>

<p>The RPi will also act as a Device Micro Controller directly
responsible for controlling the <em>throttle</em> of the DC motors.</p>

<h2 id="skid-steering">Skid Steering</h2>

<p>You can read <a href="http://mobilerobot.io/notes/skid-steering">a note on how skid steering works</a>
if you are not familiar with the concept.  Cut to the quick, operating
a <em>skid steer</em> vehicle is a matter of grouping wheels or tracks into a
left and right side, then adjusting the throttle to each group of
motors.</p>

<p>In other words, for and reverse both require the left and right groups
to turn in the same direction and the same velocity.  Turning is
implemented by varing the velocity, and possibly the direction the
motors turn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TODO place a gist here that shows usage of the Skidder class</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="mqtt-skid-channel">MQTT Skid Channel</h3>

<p>We provide an MQTT message channel &ldquo;/control/skid&rdquo; dedicated to
publishing control messages for consumption by a motor controller
managing two groups of controllers, the left group and the right group.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">% mosquitto_sub -t /control/skid 
</code></pre>

<p>Messages to control our skid steer vehical over MQTT will basically be
two floating point values between -1 and +1 inclusive.  The numbers
represent the percentage of the load to let the motors have (throttle)
and the +/- sign represents the direction the motor will turn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/control/skid:l/r</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="rest-skid-endpoint">REST Skid Endpoint</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>GET /skid/
PUT /skid/l/r</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get or Set the left and right throttles.  The throttles values are
represented by floating point numbers between -1 and 1 inclusive,
representing the percentage of load, and direction that will be
applied to the right and left throttles.</p>

<h2 id="adafruit-rpi-motor-controller">Adafruit RPi Motor Controller</h2>

<p>For this Robot, we are using the wonderful <a href="http://adafruit.com/todo">Adafruit Raspberry Pi
DC/Stepper motor controller</a>. This is the
<em>one</em> robot that we directly drive a motor controller from the
Raspberry Pi.  That aspect of this project differs than our other
robots that are built with
<a href="http://mobilerobot.io/notes/distributed-controllers">distributed controllers</a> used by the
other robots I have built.</p>

<h3 id="rpi-macro-controler-and-micro-controller">RPi Macro Controler and Micro Controller</h3>

<p>In other cases the <em>Master Controller</em> software runs run on a
Raspberry Pi (or most any other debian linux host like a laptop or
Jetson Nano) where as the <em>Micro Controller</em> typically runs on an
embedded <em>Arduino like device</em>, possibly an esp8266, esp32 or stm32.</p>

<h3 id="localized-micro-and-macro-controllers">Localized Micro and Macro Controllers</h3>

<p>In this software we will keep the same message based communication
system, as well as REST support architecture as used on the other
robots.  In this case we will implement the Micro-controller
requirements as part of the <a href="http://mobilerobot.io/todo">RPi DeviceService</a> used by the
<a href="http://mobilerobot.io/todo">Raspberry Pi Camera server</a>.</p>

<p>That means we will be able to control the voltage sent to (throttle)
the motors and hence control speed and direction the vehicle moves.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-about-performance-and-communicaiton-overhead">A Note about Performance and Communicaiton Overhead</h2>

<p>In this case the RPi with minimal sensors, low speed motors and maybe
a camera should be easily at home in a single multi-core RPi.  This
being the case, we could optimize communications by removing the
messaging and translation layers from the
<a href="http://mobilerobot.io/mobile-robot-architecture">MBR Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>However, for the sake of a single architecture and minimized set of
software tools and configurations, we will leave the communicaiton
layers in place.</p>

<p>Consistency and maintainance are extreemly important when it comes to
real-world production systems. But would we choose this over
performance in a production system?</p>

<p>The answer depends on the demands of the application, in this case, I
suspect the level of communicaiton overhead will be minimal, or
trivial when compared to the Bandwidth and other resources available.
That I believe removing the communicaitons layer would provide no
noticible, production quality performance improvements.  And at the
cost of maintanance and complexity.</p>

<p>Of course speculation takes a deep backseat to real world numbers and
careful testing.  So, I reserve the <em>right to be wrong</em>!</p>

<h3 id="brushed-dc-motors">Brushed DC Motors</h3>

<p>We are using <em>Brushed DC</em> motors, about the cheapest possible motors
one can buy.  These particular motors accept 6 to 12v.  Powering bots
is particularly important, if you want to chase your tail on weird
problems, work with under powered electronics for a while!</p>

<h2 id="powering-the-vehicle">Powering The Vehicle</h2>

<p>We can not share power with the Raspberry Pi as it does not have
nearly enough power to run two motors, especially during heavy load.
Therefore we must seek out additional power to be supplied
independently to the Motor Controller.</p>

<h3 id="motor-control-software">Motor Control Software</h3>

<p>The control software that rides on the raspberry pie will consist of,
A copy of an empty MQTT broker, most likely mosquito. It will also
consist of The control software described in (Control Software
Design)[/notes/control-software-design] in the notes section of this
site.</p>

<h3 id="speed-and-steering">Speed and Steering</h3>

<p>In this case we have a two wheel vehicle, with two motors. Our control
Algorithm will employ skid steering, The simplest possible navigation
mechanism we could develop.</p>

<p>Hence, The control algorithm will take its inputsTranslate them into
skid steer during instructions,Which basically consists of varying the
velocityOf the right and left group of wheels, In our case two
wheels.</p>

<h3 id="outputs">Outputs</h3>

<p>Since the motors are controlled directly by Adafruit software, we will
may create an individual process, separate from the control software
just to handle the motor controls.</p>
