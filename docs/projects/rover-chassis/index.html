<p>I quickly outgrew my first introductory robotics kit. I started with
my first Robotic Kit (actually 4 of them), I choose the kits that
provided the chassis only, after all, I did not know if I would want
to base it on a Raspberry Pi or Arduino (or both), perhaps something else
entirely?  Follow the story and find out what happened:</p>

<p>Introductory Robotic kits come in a dizzing array of choices, some
kits are all inclusive, they have a chassis and either wheels or
tracks for most mobile robots.</p>

<p>Some include electronics, typically a Raspberry Pi or Arduino (Arduino
Mega), some include all the sensors you need and software.  Others
supply only parts of what you need.</p>

<p>I started buying a kit, a mechanical</p>

<p>We have grown beyond the intro level kit cars, kinda of.  That is, I
want to start adding more hardware and smarter software to the kits,
however the size of the hardware becomes a challenge, not only Adding
hardware We also need to support larger heavier power supplies, As well
as significantly more complex wiring.</p>

<p>This can be tricky to dial in a nice tight design for production, That
is not necessarily the best design to go with during eight testing
phase or proof of concept, Which is what we are doing.</p>

we don&rsquo;t have to reinvent and start from scratchAnd also a physical

<h2 id="getting-started-with-a-kit">Getting Started with a Kit</h2>

<p>There are hundreds of really good kits to get started with the
robotics available for purchase online, Which is exactly how I started
kind of.</p>

<h3 id="all-inclusive-vs-bye">All Inclusive vs. BYE</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to find at least two types of kits, All-inclusive kits Will
include the mechanical vehicle or robot They will also provide the
microcontroller and various sensors.</p>

<p>A good example of this would be the Zumo robot by
Paulo(spelling?).  The better kids will includeWell-designed
hardwareAs well asGood software and good documentation. It is easy to
find kids that do a good jobOne or two of the above reported jobs of
the other Which you can create challenges.</p>

<p>But That Zumo robot seem to do a good jobOf all of the above.</p>

<p>I went with a kit (actually 4) that provided the <em>mechanical robot</em>
