      <description>Hello,
I got excited when I read your job posting, I have been working with sensor networks, and collecting timeseries data for quite a few years, on ongoing project with a long term client. And again, more recently with networks of Raspbetty Pi&amp;rsquo;s. and Arduinos.
I have read your proposal a couple times, though I do have a couple questions, I believe I have a good understanding of what you are after.</description>

      <description>The process to sending in proposals on Upwork specifically, is a little different that what it might seem like it should be.
The proposal is really the first chance you have to discuss a project with the prospect. That makes it nearly impossible to put an accurate bid together to send to the client, espcially when you do not know all the details.
 The Uplink Proposal is really to start a conversation with the prospect, not something we can confidently give a firm commitment to.</description>

      <description>All successful software and hardware projects begin with efficient communication, with A clearly established goals and objectives. I spend a significant amount of my time understanding your the objectives of your project, and a bit about your business when warrented. (I love learning about interesting businesses).
A bit of extra work upfront will speed actual development time. And significantly increase success factors.</description>
