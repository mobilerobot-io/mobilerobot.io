      <description>The process to sending in proposals on Upwork specifically, is a little different that what it might seem like it should be.
The proposal is really the first chance you have to discuss a project with the prospect. That makes it nearly impossible to put an accurate bid together to send to the client, espcially when you do not know all the details.
 The Uplink Proposal is really to start a conversation with the prospect, not something we can confidently give a firm commitment to.</description>
