<p>The process to sending in proposals on <strong>Upwork</strong> specifically, is a
little different that what it might seem like it should be.</p>

<p>The <em>proposal</em> is really the first chance you have to discuss a
project with the prospect.  That makes it nearly impossible to put an
accurate bid together to send to the client, espcially when you do not
know all the details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Uplink Proposal is really to start a conversation with the
prospect, not something we can confidently give a firm commitment
to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="read-there-job-offering">Read there Job Offering</h3>

<p>We must assure the client that we have read, understand and are quite
capable of delivering the project.  On time, budget, etc.</p>

<h3 id="sentence-1-capture-the-clients-attention">Sentence 1 ~ Capture the clients attention</h3>

<p>The client will only see the first line of our proposal response.  The
rest of the response will be hidden until they client a <em>more</em> button
to read more.</p>

<p>If the first sentence does not capture their attention and make them
want to read more, they wont.</p>

<p>The first sentence needs to capture that attention and make them want
to client on to read paragraph1.</p>

<h3 id="paragraph-1-gets-them-wanting-to-work-with-us">Paragraph 1: Gets them Wanting to Work With Us</h3>

<p>Again we need to establish in the clients mind that we have carefully
read their job listing, understand it and are very capable of
completing the job.</p>

<p>We need to establish immediately that we are easy (and efficient) to
communicate with and hopefully, even enjoyable to work with.</p>

<h3 id="paragraph-2-demonstrates-we-can-complete-the-job">Paragraph 2: Demonstrates We can Complete the Job</h3>

<p>This paragraph typically will point to one or two (three max) specific
portfolio pieces that establish our skills at performing the tasks
that we have bid on.</p>

<h3 id="paragraph-3-establishes-our-credibility">Paragraph 3: Establishes Our Credibility</h3>

<p>If they have got this far, we can NOW establish our credibility.  Our
Resume, Degrees, certifications, publications, and other ego stuff.</p>

<h3 id="call-to-action">Call To Action</h3>

<p>Try to get a <strong><em>response</em></strong> from the prospect.  We do not need to
close the deal in the proposal.  Just get the conversation started.</p>

<p>Once the conversation has started, the immediate goal is to establish
exactly the scope and <strong>intention</strong> of the prospect.</p>

<h4 id="do-not-be-too-agressive">Do NOT be too agressive</h4>

<p>We are NOT sales people.  We are problem solvers, ask them simple
questions to clearify points of the job listing and project
logistics.</p>

<p>Things like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the project milestone a proof of concept or is the project
immediately headed for production?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let them know you are available for a followup, if they are interested.</p>
