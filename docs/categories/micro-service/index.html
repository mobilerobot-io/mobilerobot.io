<p>If the Motorshield is not present, the motorcontroller library will
not be loaded, or a Fake (do nothing) library will be loaded on
devices that do not including the Adafruit MC, which includes
non-Raspberry Pi platforms.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;motors&rsquo; provides the library <code>Skidder</code> that provides a <em>Skid

<p>The videos and images can be transfered to a remote host if a network
is available, they can be saved on vehicle if no network is available
until one is.</p>

<p>The camera is also able to <em>stream</em> video over a network, if present,

<p>title: MQTT For Controllor Communication
description: &gt;
  Publish/Subscribe is an popular solution to distributed system
  communications, where you do not want to directly couple the
  publisher and subscribers.  That is a fundamental design of this MBR
  project.

<h2 id="mosquitto">- mosquitto</h2>

<p>The MQTT message bus is a simple but critical element of our MBR
software design.  MQTT provides what is known as a <em>publish/suscribe</em>
or <em>pubsub</em> communications model.  This model of machine to machine
communication has some attractive benefits for realtime driving
algorithms that we will discuss in this post.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="pubsub-message-bus-and-realtime-communications">Pubsub message bus and realtime communications</h2>

<p>The pubsub communication model boasts some properties that are
attractive to <em>a real time</em> application.  Specifically, messages can
be sent and delivered efficiently with little delay, provided none of
the resources are over burdened.</p>

<h2 id="decoupling-the-controller-from-control-object">Decoupling the Controller from Control Object</h2>

<p>Traditionally, the software, and most likely the hardware intrinsicly
ties a particular device with a specific controller.  For example, a
Joystick or Keyboard.  Replacing, say the keyboard with Joystick
control requires new  software to be added to the controlled item, as
well as created for the controller.</p>

<p>It also opens up opportunity for logging, learning, testing and
replays!</p>

<p>Keyboards, programs or canned messages can be formed to sned the same
communication.</p>

<h3 id="talk-to-the-bus">Talk to The Bus</h3>

<p>All entities talk to the bus, and read from the bus.  No two
components speak directly to one another.  This allows an incredible
amount of flexibility, but it does add a level of abstraction and
compexity.</p>

<h4 id="publishers">Publishers</h4>

<p>Adding a message bus requires us to adjust from a tight,
input -&gt; output coupling to a <em>decoupled</em> intention based messaging
system.</p>

<p>For example, a Joystick can publish rapid stick movement /
positioning informaiton to an MQTT bus such that <em>subscribers</em> like
the <em>Control software</em>, a logger or debugger as well.</p>

<p>A temprature sensor may send out periodic temprature. Distance, light,
heat and other sensor can periodical advertise to appropriate
channels.</p>

<h2 id="funcation-call-rest-vs-pub-sub">Funcation Call, REST vs. Pub/Sub</h2>

<p>[Todo] put a link here to a page that compares communication models:
such as Routing Protocols, Web/REST servers, RealTime sockets,
Real-time Websockets, real time messaging.</p>

<h3 id="mbr-and-the-pubsub-commuication-model">MBR and the Pubsub Commuication Model</h3>

<p>For our application, we will be controlling a set of DC motors through
a micro-controller (i.e. Arduino with shield) attached via some
serial/RF/BT/??? mechanism.</p>

<p>For this project we will focus on the MQTT protocol and we will
specifically use <em>Mosquitto</em> the MQTT broker.</p>

<p>useful for many types of computer communication,
including <em>real time</em> control software, like we use to drive our
mobile vehicle.  This article will go into detail on our controll
system software and the various components required to make it happen!</p>

<p>The MQTT message server a general purpose as a systems message bus our
project components can use to read and write data in near realtime.
This data is used for a number of purposes, to advertise changes to
control inputs and sensors, publish control messages to motor
controllors and by the dashboard to display our realtime sensor
data. This describes how our MQTT bus is being used and how we got it
all hooked up!</p>

<h2 id="mqtt-bus-uses">MQTT Bus Uses</h2>

<ul>
<li>Advertise Joystick inputs for vehicle control</li>
<li>Advertise Sensor readings for sensor networks</li>
<li>Consume vehical controls by the motor controllers</li>
<li>Consume all sorts of data for the Dashboard and realtime graphs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>Mosquitto MQTT Broker is running on a system wide Raspberry Pi. All
sensor and control inputs are written to the appropriate topics on the
MQTT bus.</p>

<p>In the future we&rsquo;ll want to run an MQTT bus on vehical incase we
loose contact with our control station.</p>

		    Otto the Pluggable Macro Controller Micro Service
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    

<p>Otto is a small, simple <em>micro-server</em> written in Go. It handles
requisit communications and related infra structure required by
servers and controllers.  The applications and functionality will be
provided via pluggins.</p>

<p>Otto can run as a REST server in a data center or the controller on
micro-controller type of computer.  Otto was developed with the notion
that much of the code that makes for a good server (or any application
for that matter) requires redundant but import supporting
infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="otto-core">Otto Core</h2>

<p>The Otto core provides the following support out of the box, available
to all plugins that require these services out of the box.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Communication Handlers for REST, HTML, SPA, Websocket and MQTT
Messaging.  Additionally: Configuration Management, Logging, Stats
Collection and Plugin Management</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The plugins can be combined in any combination to achieve precisely
the functionality needed for a given circumstance.</p>

<h2 id="current-plugins">Current Plugins</h2>

<p>Plugins are very simple to write, they are basically <em>Go Plugins</em> with
public Name() and Register() functions.  The Register() function
essentially registers handlers with otto to recieve events and
corresponding event info.</p>

<p>This is the current list of otto plugins.  Plugins can be written
anywhere and loaded by Otto.  These just happen to share Otto&rsquo;s
repository.</p>

<ul>
<li>Echo  ~ send data, or a message and get it back.</li>
<li>Store ~ persistant storage of Go objects as JSON strings</li>
<li>Dork  ~ cloud based compute and storage monitor</li>
<li>Wally ~ website page walker / scrapper</li>
<li>Monty ~ mico-controller monitoring program</li>
</ul>
