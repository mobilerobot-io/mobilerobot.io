		    Inexpensive Motor Controllers for Arduino and Raspberry Pi
		</div>

<p>What are the first things to consider when developing a mobile robot
Is how you&rsquo;re going to make it move, and that is typically using
motors.  The cool thing is that inexpensive electrical motors are
plentiful, however putting them to good use is a bit complex, Here we
will conquer some of that complexity.</p>

<p>We will consider the following 3 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>What <em>type</em> of motor(s) do we need?</li>
<li>How are we going to <em>power</em> them?</li>
<li>How are we going to <em>control</em> them?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tldr-summary">TLDR - Summary</h2>

<p>I have settled on the Adafruit MotorSheilds for Arudino and Raspberry
Pi as general purpose options.  At the moment, my ideal setup involves
a RPi as the controller with an I2C or SPI connection to an Arduino
with a MotorController.</p>

<p>But not for every circumstance.  It always depends on the application,
having said that, let me explain what I have found (very little) so
far with inexpensive electric motors&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements</h2>

<p>First let me frame this discussion, I am strictly talking about cheap
DC motors (not AC that plug into the wall like a washing machine) that
can be had for less than $10USD, often less than $1 or found in scrap
electronics.</p>

<p>The first three motor types I discovered are the ubiquitous: DC
<em>brushed motor</em>, <em>toy servos</em> and <em>stepper motors</em>.  Incase you are
uninformed like I was in early 2018..</p>

<h3 id="select-motors-and-motor-controller">Select Motors and Motor Controller</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to select the motors and the
corresponding <em>motor controller</em> we need to control our vehicle.  The
motorshield will come as an attachment to a micro controller of some
sort, which happens to be either an Arduino or Raspiberry Pi, in my
case.</p>

<h3 id="brushed-motors-move-wheels">Brushed Motors Move Wheels</h3>

<p>In a nutshell, the brushed motors we&rsquo;ll use to turn the wheels of the
vehicle, they have the advantages of being easily controlled (speed
up, slow down, stop) with just two wires (+ and -), the direction
of the motor can be changed simply by reversing the current to the
motor.</p>

<p>They are also really cheap and can be found every where, including
scrap electronic toys and utilties.</p>

<h3 id="servos-to-pan-and-tilt-camera">Servos to Pan and Tilt Camera</h3>

<p>We will include two inexpensive <em>servos</em> onto the vehicle to handle
the <em>pan and tilt</em> camera functions.</p>

<h2 id="drive-train">Drive Train</h2>

<p>Moving the vehicle is one thing, steering it is a whole nother
thang. Fortunantely for us, we are going to adopt the fine art of
<strong>skid steering</strong>, the age old method of how the caveman commutted
back in the day.</p>

<h3 id="skid-steering">Skid Steering</h3>

<p>My primary vehical is a 4wd, that is 4 DC motors directy spinning two
rubber tires.  I also have available two, two wheeled vehicals and a
<em>train tracked</em> vehical.</p>

<p>In all cases each of these vehicle employ <em>skid steering</em> on account a
one wheel (wheels or tread) will be skidding along when your turnin.</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:1313/todo/skid-steering">TODO ~ Create a skid steering page</a></p>

<p>Of course, you can get real fancy and spin the thing on axis by
employing equal forces of forward and reverse on opposing sides of the
vehicle.  Which does have significant advantages in tight areas such
as those found in long corridors, warehouses and such.</p>

<h2 id="required-motors-and-controller">Required Motors and Controller</h2>

<p>We need to power the following motors (at minimum):</p>

<ul>
<li>4 DC Motors</li>
<li>2 Servos</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut to the chase, the Adafruit XXXXX Arduino motor controller, and the
sister Adafruit YYYY stepper motor controller for the Raspberry Pi are
two such controllers that suite our purposes perfectly well.</p>

<h3 id="which-microcontroller-microcomputer">Which MicroController (MicroComputer)?</h3>

<p>Todo has a discussion of using a Raspberry Pi + MotorController or
Arduino + Motor Controller.</p>

<h3 id="alternative-shields">Alternative Shields</h3>

<h3 id="adafruit-sheild-v1-v2">Adafruit Sheild v1 &amp; v2</h3>

<p>Adafruit essentially has two versions of their MotorShield v1 and now
v2. &hellip;</p>

<h4 id="version-2-i2c">Version 2 I2C</h4>

<p>Version 2 of the AFMS runs over the I2C bus.</p>

<h3 id="osepp-shields-v1-v2">OSEPP Shields v1 &amp; v2</h3>

<p>The OSEPP MotorSheilds effectively duplicate the functionality of the
Adafruite MotorShields.</p>

<p>The documentation is hard to find and must be pieced together through
the documentation of their hardware kits.  I do find the hardware to
be of a sturdy make.  The use connectors to help in learning, the
Adafruit are more through for real prototyping.</p>

<h2 id="motor-software">Motor Software</h2>

<p>Adafruit software for Arduino MC and Raspberry Pi MC.</p>

<h3 id="mqtt-and-motor-control-channel">MQTT and Motor Control Channel</h3>

<p>Connect the motor controller to the MQTT control channel.  NOTE: on
vehicle may use the motor control channel when availble, however, must
always be able to regain control (or shutdown completely) if the
control channel has been lost.</p>
