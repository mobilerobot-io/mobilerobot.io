      <description>The Red Eye project is a simple service wrapper around the most excellent PiCamera library, it also attaches a gstreamerpipelines pipeline to the output video stream(s) that will be recieved by a variety of consumers, including Storage / Archive, Computer Vision / Machine Learning and Display modules.
Multiple Live Streams A really cool feature of the Raspberry Pi Camera (the XXX family of chips) is the ability to deliver multiple streams of video at the same time, like different resolutions, snapshots and such.</description>

      <description>Skid steering basics
 Based on fixed direction wheels[1] or tracks There are two groups or sides of wheels: left and right All wheels in a group MUST always point in the same direction All wheels in a group MUST always rotate at the same rate Direction is determined by the speed of the two wheel groups  To move straight all motors rotate at the same rate Forward and Reverse are determined by positive and negative values Turning is achieved by varying the throttle on the right and left   Example The Skidder class has the following API, as you can see all of the movements we desire can be accomplished with a single API call</description>

Raspberry Pi and connected &lt;em&gt;7 inch touchscreen tablet&lt;/em&gt;.  I have it
setup in &amp;ldquo;kiosk mode&amp;rdquo;, which is basically full page chrome without the
tabs and tool bars etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
