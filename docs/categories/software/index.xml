      <description>One of the first issues that we came against was the specific configurations of the micro-controllers as well and the number and configuration of pins and hardware particulars.
Macro-Micro Controllers The system should be flexible enough to allow one or more macro-controls communicating with one or more micro-controllers.
Communication Mechanism We have a rather complex set of communication requirements, we have signals between sensors, motors and micro-controllers. We also have the communication from the micro-controllers and the macro-controller.</description>

      <description>The controller has two primary parts, the hardware and sofware elements. A good system design, like ours will separate the specific hardware and the controlling software.
Hardware Requirements  wireless ~ but which  The vehicle will be automous, hence it needs to be free of tethers, both electronics, controls and power.
