      <description>One of the first issues that we came against was the specific configurations of the micro-controllers as well and the number and configuration of pins and hardware particulars.
Macro-Micro Controllers The system should be flexible enough to allow one or more macro-controls communicating with one or more micro-controllers.
Communication Mechanism We have a rather complex set of communication requirements, we have signals between sensors, motors and micro-controllers. We also have the communication from the micro-controllers and the macro-controller.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I lead a team at Cisco Systems to build a system that would deliver
streaming video to millions of users, simultaneously. That same
technology has been used by DIRECTV, TimeWarner Cable, AT&amp;amp;T and
other major

      <description>The controller has two primary parts, the hardware and sofware elements. A good system design, like ours will separate the specific hardware and the controlling software.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is full of things that rely on software to work, from
sprinkler systems, to cars and jet airplanes, laptops, cell phones and
drones.  You name it everything. Now lets consider how we use it.
