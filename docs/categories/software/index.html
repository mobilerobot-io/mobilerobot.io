		    Red Eye Video Server
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    

<p>The Red Eye project is a service definition rapper around inexpensive
cameras attached to inexpesive micro-controllers that take pretty good
video.</p>

<p>The video streams are built using the GStreamer library. The camera
native capabilities are used to extract as high quailty, realtime
images possible.</p>

<p>The video streams will be consumed by one or more sinks, including but
not limited to Files, cloud storage, High Def Display and Computer
Vision libraries.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-live-streams">Multiple Live Streams</h2>

<p>A really cool feature of the Raspberry Pi Camera, that we will be
explioting is it&rsquo;s ability to deliver multiple streams of video at the
same time, such as different resolutions, snapshots and such.</p>

<h3 id="high-def-live-viewing">High Def Live Viewing</h3>

<p>The PiCamera has the capability of streaming multiple streams, we will
take advantage of this by having the camera send a High Def stream for
<em>real time display</em> and to be <em>archived and replayed</em>.</p>

<h3 id="low-definition-to-opencv">Low Definition To OpenCV</h3>

<p>Computer Vision algorithms can benefit by working with lower
resolution versions of live images.  The algorithms calculate with a
small number of pixels and go faster.</p>

<h3 id="snapshots">Snapshots</h3>

<p>There are a number of reasons we may want to take an store
<em>snapshots</em> to capture various events, we&rsquo;ll get into that later, but
for now the requirements we will need to take snapshots and save
them.</p>

<h2 id="camera-control-inputs">Camera Control Inputs</h2>

<p>A control channel is available to modify camera behavior during
operations, which may include changing configuration, start and
stop video streams, and so.</p>

<p>The control inputs can be the result of a REST Command, MQTT message
or Websockets interface.</p>

<h2 id="streaming-video">Streaming Video</h2>

<p>The video streams are produced by the camera in H.264, so we need to
do a little bit of work to get the video into multicast video
streams.</p>

<h3 id="multicast-rtp">Multicast RTP</h3>

<p>The video streams produced by the video will need a little turning
them into video streams of some sort.  Our scheme is such that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Video streams may be recieved by more than one consumer</p></li>

<li><p>We do not want Video producer to have to know <em>who</em> is recieving
and when..  Multicast will just be sent as long as there is any
consumer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We will need to piece together the series of filters to recieve the
video from Rasberry Pi, to gstreamer that will turn the video into
UDP, RTP, RTSP multicast streams.</p>

<h3 id="video-consumers">Video Consumers</h3>

<p>The Video is streamed for live consumption as well as storage and
retrieval.  For this, high definition video is likely to be needed.</p>

<p>Video will also be consumed by computer vision algorithms, in this
case, the lower resolution images help the algorithms plow through
pixels much faster.</p>

<p>Snapshot can be extracted from a video stream.</p>

<h2 id="control-communications">Control Communications</h2>

<p>The camera has a rich set of configuration options and modes that it
can operate under.  We are wrapping the configuration options, as well
as control time commands like starting and stoping streams.</p>

<p>Additional commands may be set to start time lapse snapshots and quick
auto-sequence shots.  The control commands can be set off throught the
following API channels:</p>

<ul>
<li>REST</li>
<li>MQTT</li>
<li>Websockets</li>
</ul>

<p>All control channels flowing into a single Interface / API with the
explicit goal to maintain consistency regardless of the channel used
to communicate controls.</p>

<h2 id="tactile-controls">Tactile Controls</h2>

<p>The GPIO pins can be used to trigger camera events, simple things like
pushing a button to take a snapshot, or triggering a snapshot when a
switch is flipped, for example.</p>

<h2 id="software-library-dependencies">Software Library Dependencies</h2>

<ul>
<li>PiCamera to operate the camera</li>
<li>Flask for REST and Web Interface</li>
<li>Paho MQTT for Control Bus</li>
<li>gstreamer to stream captured video

<ul>
<li>raspberry Pi gstreamer src plugin</li>
<li>gstreamer RTP/RTSP streaming</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cloud Libraries to save data offline storage</li>

		    Skid Steering
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    

<p>Skid steering basics</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on <em>fixed direction wheels[1] or tracks</em></li>
<li>There are two <em>groups</em> or <em>sides</em> of wheels: left and right</li>
<li>All wheels in a group MUST always point in the same direction</li>
<li>All wheels in a group MUST always rotate at the same rate</li>
<li>Direction is determined by the speed of the two wheel groups

<ul>
<li>To move straight all motors rotate at the same rate</li>
<li>Forward and Reverse are determined by positive and negative values</li>
<li>Turning is achieved by varying the throttle on the right and left</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>The <code>Skidder</code> class has the following API, as you can see all of
the movements we desire can be accomplished with a single API call</p>

<pre><code class="language-skidder.set_throttle(left_throttle,">does not get much simpler than this!

```python
skidder = Skidder()

# Move forward at full speed
skidder.set_throttle(1, 1)

# Move in reverse at half throttle
skidder.set_throttle(-0.5, -0.5)

# Turn right arch at 60% 
skidder.set_throttle(.6, 0)

# Turn left on a dime (and fast) at 70%
skidder.set_throttle(-0.7, 0.7)

# Stop
skidder.set_throttle(0, 0)

# Coast 
skidder.set_throttle(None, None)
</code></pre>

<p>With this simple library we can control the most simple of Mobile
Robots (or maybe a forklift).</p>

<h3 id="note-about-speed-and-accuracy">Note About Speed and Accuracy</h3>

<p>This library is very simple, it only knows how to control the
<strong><em>percentage of potential load</em></strong> the motors will be provided.  The
Adafruit library appropriate uses the term <strong>throttle</strong>, because we
can not know the <strong>speed</strong> of the motor without some form of
<strong>external feedback</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="can-not-directly-control-speed">Can NOT Directly Control Speed!</h4>

<p>Of course, the library does not know what motors are being used, how
they are geared (how the gear ratio&rsquo;s are set).  Even if we knew the
motors, we still do not know, directly the load being supplied which
will directly effect the rotation of the motors.</p>

<h4 id="nor-control-turn-radius">Nor Control Turn Radius</h4>

<p>It follows to reason that the inability to control <em>speed</em> directly
also means that we can NOT control the degree of our turns!  For
example a faster spinning motor will rotate a chasis more degrees than
a slower rotating motor.  This can be changed simply by the power
supply being used, including the charge if batteries are being used.</p>

<h3 id="external-feedback-required">External Feedback Required</h3>

<p>This is not such a big deal when the vehicle is controlled by a Human,
the humans makes control decisions in their brains and translate that
to DATA INPUTS, from a joystick or keyboard possibly.</p>

<h4 id="computer-controls-require-external-feedback">Computer Controls Require External Feedback</h4>

<p>For the reasons stated above, Skid steering requires external feedback
to be accurately used with computer automated controlers, like <a href="http://github.com/mobilerobot-io/otto">otto&rsquo;s
magoo</a>.</p>

<p>The possibilities for external controls are many! Including distance
sensors, computer vision, radar, maps of many varieties, etc. The
choices are so vast that we would be remis to become too committed to
one or two technologies.</p>

<p>For that reason our <a href="http://mobilerobot-io/rpid">Raspberry Pi Device Controller
(rpid)</a> project was created to allow for
external feedback of incoming <em>new state</em> combined with existing state
measured against the <em>desired state</em> creates a new objective that
will in turn be translated into a Control OUTPUT to the <em>skid</em> channel
with a left and right throttles to effectively control the vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="skid-steering-demonstrated">Skid Steering Demonstrated</h3>

<p>Here are some diagrams and a video demonstrating <em>skid steering</em> in
real life:</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer-semantics-of-the-term-wheel">Disclaimer ~ Semantics of the term Wheel</h2>

<p>[1] Disclaimer ~ I will often use the term wheels in a very generic
sense, sometimes the use of wheels is specificly to wheels, sometimes
I will use it generically to include [tank tracks] or other types
of elements that rotate to move the vehicle.</p>

<p>As distinguished from <em>legs</em> or other types of <em>mobility enablers</em>.</p>

		    Control Station Display
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    <p>We are going to build a simple control station that begins with a
Raspberry Pi and connected <em>7 inch touchscreen tablet</em>.  I have it
setup in &ldquo;kiosk mode&rdquo;, which is basically full page chrome without the
tabs and tool bars etc.</p>

<p>The touchscreen installation was nearly trivial, though I am using two
power supplies, it would complain with just one.</p>

<p>I decided that it would really cool to use a Raspberry Pi as the
<em>control station</em> for MBR, even cooler, why not attach a 7in touch
screen to the RPI for configuring and monitoring the robot / system.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power</h2>

<p>The standard power taken from Mains should be fed with a 2Amp power
supply connected to the <strong>Display Adapter Card</strong>.</p>

<p>You can optionally attach and additional 2am power supply to the
RaspiBerry Pi thus driving power to the display and adapter card, in
addition to the power supplied to the display, thus powering the Pi
and Display seperately.</p>

<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>

<p>Graphics for control software can be done in a number of different
ways.  Unless compelled by good reason otherwise, we&rsquo;ll stick to
webapps: HTML, CSS and JavaScript through a web server.</p>

<p>This will allow us the most bang for our buck.</p>

<p>TODO: add a pic of the control station.</p>

<h2 id="chromium-kiosk-mode">Chromium Kiosk Mode</h2>

<p>Our user interface will be local server software that will provider
our controller with everyting it needs to do to control our mobile
robots and assocociated components.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TODO ~ locate the chromium kiosk mode and how to start in that
mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="monitor-mode">Monitor Mode</h3>

<p>Monitor mode will provide us with a <em>health status</em> of our
environment, Configuration mode allows us to modify configurations and
control mode allows us to control our vehicles.</p>

<p>We are going to write a Webapp served up by the local machine, which
will be run in Kiosk mode.  We&rsquo;ll need to determine all the screens
that will run in Kiosk mode, but we will have our local server,
serving up some cool stuff!</p>

<h2 id="additional-spi-pins">Additional SPI(?) Pins</h2>

<p>The adapter board attached to the screen has a couple additional pins
that allow stuff.</p>

<p>TODO: check out the pins on this display</p>
