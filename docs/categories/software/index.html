		    OpenCV Installing and Getting Started on Raspberry Pi
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    

<p>Install OpenCV on a raspberry pie, at least how I have been trying to
do it, by downloading the source code and building has been a very
tedious task, for which I have yet to celebrate any form of success.</p>

<h2 id="on-to-plan-b">On to Plan B</h2>

<p>Therefore I think I am going to head off and try plan B, for now Plan B is
one of the following three options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use PXE to boot The raspberry pie and mount the file systems over
NFS.  I can then install OpenCV without concern for running out of
space on the SD card.  In there the build should also go faster.</p></li>

<li><p>The second option would be simply to use raspberry pipe to stream
the video from the raspberry pie to a another computer connected to
the network that will then be able to process the streaming video.</p></li>

<li><p>A third option is to store the video locally and a later
uploaded the video for post mobile processing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The third option is really not an option it is more of a feature that
required rather than a replacement for <em>Real Time</em> OpenCV processing.</p>

<p>Post process looses the <em>Real Time</em> aspect of our camera and hence an
import requirement for the project.   But an important fallback
feature just the same.</p>

<h2 id="opencv-on-linux-virtualbox">OpenCV on Linux VirtualBox</h2>

<p>I am also manage some back up and install a open CV on my Mac
laptopWhich is becoming cluttered with a bunch nonsense, So I think I
will install open CD on a virtualMachine running clinicsAndy done with
it.</p>

<p>I can use this to process Video Streams from a Raspberry Pi, at least
in theory.  But then if we can not do this, we are in really bad
shape!</p>

<h3 id="settle-for-opencv-2-on-rpi">Settle For OpenCV 2 on RPI</h3>

<p>Well, as far as on vehicle processing, I am going to stick with
OpenCV-2 (ancient, OpenCV 4.0 recently released) but trying to build
was way to slow, so any software built on vehicle will have to be
constrained to OpenCV 2.0 for now.</p>

<p>Hopefully soon enough somebody will update the situation, which I
expect will be soon.</p>

<h2 id="installed-opencv-4-0-1-on-vm">Installed OpenCV 4.0.1 on VM</h2>

<p>In the mean time, we can move our OpenCV 4.0 processing to a desktop
or VM for now.</p>

<p>To that end I compiled OpenCV straight from the github now ready to
go.</p>

<h3 id="stream-from-rpi-to-host">Stream From RPI to Host?</h3>

<p>We could go for streaming the video from the RPI to the host with
OpenCV 4.0 for advanced processing.  That sounds like something sexy
to do, but I wonder what the performance would be?</p>

<h4 id="what-about-performance">What about Performance?</h4>

		<div class="card-body">
		    <p>These days, it is hard to assume anything about the platform that we
may be developing on. For example, an <em>Arduino</em> or <em>Cloud Native</em>
applicaiton might not have a local disk to write to.</p>

<p>Source code for <a href="http://github.com/">store is here</a></p>

<p>Or an perhaps an embedded micro controller may temporarily not have
access to the internet and need temporary storage.  These cases need
to be taken into account in addition to the traditional
<em>&ldquo;persistance&rdquo;</em> issues need to be delt with.</p>

<p>Once frequent thing to do when programming with Go would be
<em>marshalling</em> native Go objects to disk as text files formatted as
JSON.  The <em>store</em> library does this automatically for you.</p>

<p>Our <em>mobile robot</em> is going to need a remote control, may as well be a
joystick.  Yes, we do have high hopes of getting the vehicle to drive
itself, we are still going to support a Human controlled switch over.</p>

<p>Following is a quick-n-dirty block diagram of the project design.</p>

<h3 id="rf-remote-control-electronics">RF Remote Control Electronics</h3>

<p>The first pass at the remote control will be a single joystick on the
RC station.  Additional controls like buttons, or a screen for output
are on the whishlist.</p>

<p>A single remote joystick is what we need for starters.  We are going
to use the very popular <a href="http://mobilerobot.io/notes/programming-the-nlrf24l01">NRF24L01 chip</a>.</p>

if you want to be able to get a notification when data has arrived

<p>Arduino&rsquo;s are loyal, strong soldiers that will faithfully follow
orders, however they are pretty dumb, at least compared to a Raspberry
Pi.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi consumes a significant amount of energy, and provides
a tremendous amount of processing power compared to the Arduino.</p>

<p>For now, we are going to keep it cheap and accessable our choices of
hardware micro/macro controllers to be from the Arduino and Raspberry
Pi family of products.</p>
