<p>Skid steering basics</p>

<ul>
<li>Based on <em>fixed direction wheels[1] or tracks</em></li>
<li>There are two <em>groups</em> or <em>sides</em> of wheels: left and right</li>
<li>All wheels in a group MUST always point in the same direction</li>
<li>All wheels in a group MUST always rotate at the same rate</li>
<li>Direction is determined by the speed of the two wheel groups

<ul>
<li>To move straight all motors rotate at the same rate</li>
<li>Forward and Reverse are determined by positive and negative values</li>
<li>Turning is achieved by varying the throttle on the right and left</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>The <code>Skidder</code> class has the following API, as you can see all of
the movements we desire can be accomplished with a single API call</p>

<pre><code class="language-skidder.set_throttle(left_throttle,">does not get much simpler than this!

```python
skidder = Skidder()

# Move forward at full speed
skidder.set_throttle(1, 1)

# Move in reverse at half throttle
skidder.set_throttle(-0.5, -0.5)

# Turn right arch at 60% 
skidder.set_throttle(.6, 0)

# Turn left on a dime (and fast) at 70%
skidder.set_throttle(-0.7, 0.7)

# Stop
skidder.set_throttle(0, 0)

# Coast 
skidder.set_throttle(None, None)
</code></pre>

<p>With this simple library we can control the most simple of Mobile
Robots (or maybe a forklift).</p>

<h3 id="note-about-speed-and-accuracy">Note About Speed and Accuracy</h3>

<p>This library is very simple, it only knows how to control the
<strong><em>percentage of potential load</em></strong> the motors will be provided.  The
Adafruit library appropriate uses the term <strong>throttle</strong>, because we
can not know the <strong>speed</strong> of the motor without some form of
<strong>external feedback</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="can-not-directly-control-speed">Can NOT Directly Control Speed!</h4>

<p>Of course, the library does not know what motors are being used, how
they are geared (how the gear ratio&rsquo;s are set).  Even if we knew the
motors, we still do not know, directly the load being supplied which
will directly effect the rotation of the motors.</p>

<h4 id="nor-control-turn-radius">Nor Control Turn Radius</h4>

<p>It follows to reason that the inability to control <em>speed</em> directly
also means that we can NOT control the degree of our turns!  For
example a faster spinning motor will rotate a chasis more degrees than
a slower rotating motor.  This can be changed simply by the power
supply being used, including the charge if batteries are being used.</p>

<h3 id="external-feedback-required">External Feedback Required</h3>

<p>This is not such a big deal when the vehicle is controlled by a Human,
the humans makes control decisions in their brains and translate that
to DATA INPUTS, from a joystick or keyboard possibly.</p>

<h4 id="computer-controls-require-external-feedback">Computer Controls Require External Feedback</h4>

<p>For the reasons stated above, Skid steering requires external feedback
to be accurately used with computer automated controlers, like <a href="http://github.com/mobilerobot-io/otto">otto&rsquo;s
magoo</a>.</p>

<p>The possibilities for external controls are many! Including distance
sensors, computer vision, radar, maps of many varieties, etc. The
choices are so vast that we would be remis to become too committed to
one or two technologies.</p>

<p>For that reason our <a href="http://mobilerobot-io/rpid">Raspberry Pi Device Controller
(rpid)</a> project was created to allow for
external feedback of incoming <em>new state</em> combined with existing state
measured against the <em>desired state</em> creates a new objective that
will in turn be translated into a Control OUTPUT to the <em>skid</em> channel
with a left and right throttles to effectively control the vehicle.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer-semantics-of-the-term-wheel">Disclaimer ~ Semantics of the term Wheel</h2>

<p>[1] Disclaimer ~ I will often use the term wheels in a very generic
sense, sometimes the use of wheels is specificly to wheels, sometimes
I will use it generically to include [tank tracks] or other types
of elements that rotate to move the vehicle.</p>

<p>As distinguished from <em>legs</em> or other types of <em>mobility enablers</em>.</p>

<h3 id="mqtt-skid-channel">MQTT Skid Channel</h3>

<p>We provide an MQTT message channel &ldquo;/control/skid&rdquo; dedicated to

managing two groups of controllers, the left group and the right group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subscripe to the /control/skid channel</p>

<p>Messages to control our skid steer vehical over MQTT will basically be
two floating point values between -1 and +1 inclusive.  The numbers

<h2 id="adafruit-rpi-motor-controller">Adafruit RPi Motor Controller</h2>

<p>For this Robot, we are using the wonderful <a href="http://adafruit.com/todo">Adafruit Raspberry Pi
DC/Stepper motor controller</a>. This is the
<em>one</em> robot that we directly drive a motor controller from the
Raspberry Pi.  That aspect of this project differs than our other
robots that are built with
<a href="http://mobilerobot.io/notes/distributed-controllers">distributed controllers</a> used by the
other robots I have built.</p>

<h3 id="rpi-macro-controler-and-micro-controller">RPi Macro Controler and Micro Controller</h3>

<p>In other cases the <em>Master Controller</em> software runs run on a
Raspberry Pi (or most any other debian linux host like a laptop or
Jetson Nano) where as the <em>Micro Controller</em> typically runs on an
embedded <em>Arduino like device</em>, possibly an esp8266, esp32 or stm32.</p>

<h3 id="localized-micro-and-macro-controllers">Localized Micro and Macro Controllers</h3>

<p>In this software we will keep the same message based communication
system, as well as REST support architecture as used on the other
robots.  In this case we will implement the Micro-controller
requirements as part of the <a href="http://mobilerobot.io/todo">RPi DeviceService</a> used by the
<a href="http://mobilerobot.io/todo">Raspberry Pi Camera server</a>.</p>

<p>That means we will be able to control the voltage sent to (throttle)
the motors and hence control speed and direction the vehicle moves.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-about-performance-and-communicaiton-overhead">A Note about Performance and Communicaiton Overhead</h2>

<p>In this case the RPi with minimal sensors, low speed motors and maybe
a camera should be easily at home in a single multi-core RPi.  This
being the case, we could optimize communications by removing the
messaging and translation layers from the
<a href="http://mobilerobot.io/mobile-robot-architecture">MBR Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>However, for the sake of a single architecture and minimized set of
software tools and configurations, we will leave the communicaiton
layers in place.</p>

<p>Consistency and maintainance are extreemly important when it comes to
real-world production systems. But would we choose this over
performance in a production system?</p>

<p>The answer depends on the demands of the application, in this case, I
suspect the level of communicaiton overhead will be minimal, or
trivial when compared to the Bandwidth and other resources available.
That I believe removing the communicaitons layer would provide no
noticible, production quality performance improvements.  And at the
cost of maintanance and complexity.</p>

<p>Of course speculation takes a deep backseat to real world numbers and
careful testing.  So, I reserve the <em>right to be wrong</em>!</p>

<h3 id="brushed-dc-motors">Brushed DC Motors</h3>

<p>We are using <em>Brushed DC</em> motors, about the cheapest possible motors
one can buy.  These particular motors accept 6 to 12v.  Powering bots
is particularly important, if you want to chase your tail on weird
problems, work with under powered electronics for a while!</p>

<h2 id="powering-the-vehicle">Powering The Vehicle</h2>

<p>We can not share power with the Raspberry Pi as it does not have
nearly enough power to run two motors, especially during heavy load.
Therefore we must seek out additional power to be supplied
independently to the Motor Controller.</p>

<h3 id="motor-control-software">Motor Control Software</h3>

<p>The control software that rides on the raspberry pie will consist of,
A copy of an empty MQTT broker, most likely mosquito. It will also
consist of The control software described in (Control Software
Design)[/notes/control-software-design] in the notes section of this
site.</p>

<h3 id="speed-and-steering">Speed and Steering</h3>

<p>In this case we have a two wheel vehicle, with two motors. Our control
Algorithm will employ skid steering, The simplest possible navigation
mechanism we could develop.</p>

<p>Hence, The control algorithm will take its inputsTranslate them into
skid steer during instructions,Which basically consists of varying the
velocityOf the right and left group of wheels, In our case two
wheels.</p>

<h3 id="outputs">Outputs</h3>

<p>Since the motors are controlled directly by Adafruit software, we will
may create an individual process, separate from the control software
just to handle the motor controls.</p>

		    TLV the Type Length Vector Protocol
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    <p>TLV is a very simple communication protocol that can be used to send
messages around a complex, distributed system.</p>

<p>The TLV protocol provides only message formatting by definition.  How
the application handles said messages is up to the application, that
is NO assumptions or gaurauntees about losing message, parts of
messages, ordering or retransmission.</p>

<p>If any of these more advanced capabilities are to be provided, they
must be done so at the application layer (so to speak).</p>

<h3 id="generic-underlying-transports">Generic Underlying Transports</h3>

<p>The underlying physical and mac layers will have a huge effect on the
possibility of packet loss, ordering, delay and possible bandwidth.
Each of the communicaiton mediums we use, we will post a comparison of
characteristics, bandwidth, delay and reliability amoung other
things.</p>

<h2 id="tlv-and-tlstring">TLV and TLString</h2>

<p>Type, Length Vector (Value) is as old as the hills, but still just as
useful!  Type length Vector is byte oriented, with three types of
messages: compact (1 byte), short (2 bytes) and full (up to 0xffff
size).</p>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  Type  | Length | Value  ...
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
</code></pre>

<p>The first byte is the type of message, the second byte is the length
of the message, inclusive, that is the 2 bytes of the Tyte and Length
field are INCLUDED in the Length of the message.</p>

<h3 id="compact-messages">Compact Messages</h3>

<p>The nature of many types of communication are just quick short
messages that only require a single byte, which not only determines
the <em>type</em> of message, it also supplies <em>no payload</em> beyond the type.</p>

<p>In this case, TLV supports the message type <strong>compact</strong> or
<strong>1-byte</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="short-messages">Short Messages</h3>

<p>In a similar vein, some types my contain only a single value, for
example a sensor value between 0 &amp; 0xff can be advertised with only
two bytes.</p>

<p>Normally, a two byte message: 1-byte for type and 1 byte for the
length would require a 3rd byte for the value.  Hence, that makes the
two byte message unused.</p>

<p>To that end, we provide a 2nd small optimization: Short messages
support the message type and a message value between 0x0 and 0xff in
the length field, thus reducing the <em>Short Message</em> from 3 bytes to 2
bytes.</p>

<h3 id="distinguishing-compact-short-and-normal-packets">Distinguishing Compact, Short and Normal Packets</h3>

<p>The packet types can be identified by the first two bytes of the type
field.  Compact packets always have the first two bits of the type
set:</p>

<h4 id="compact-packets">Compact Packets</h4>

<pre><code>+--------+
|11xxxxxx|
+--------+
</code></pre>

<p>Compact packets are a single byte in the <strong>range of 0xC0 to 0xFF</strong>,
depending on how the remaining 2^6 bits are set.</p>

<h4 id="short-packets">Short Packets</h4>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+
|10xxxxxx| Value  |
+--------+--------+
</code></pre>

<h4 id="reserved-packets">Reserved Packets</h4>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+
|01xxxxxx| Value  |
+--------+--------+

The reserved range can be associated with the Short or Regular packet
types is one type is getting used up quicker than another.

</code></pre>

<p>Short packets are two bytes, with the type value in the range of 0x80
to 0xBF.  Again, short packets have (2^6 = 32)  independent types.</p>

<h4 id="regular-packets">Regular Packets</h4>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|00  Type  | Length | Value  ...
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
</code></pre>

<p>If desired, the compact and short packets can be turned off,
altogether allocating the entire 2^8 == 256 types to be regular
messages.</p>

<p>title: MQTT For Controllor Communication
description: &gt;
  Publish/Subscribe is an popular solution to distributed system
  communications, where you do not want to directly couple the
  publisher and subscribers.  That is a fundamental design of this MBR
  project.
date: 2019-05-03

<h2 id="mosquitto">- mosquitto</h2>

<p>The MQTT message bus is a simple but critical element of our MBR
software design.  MQTT provides what is known as a <em>publish/suscribe</em>
or <em>pubsub</em> communications model.  This model of machine to machine
communication has some attractive benefits for realtime driving
algorithms that we will discuss in this post.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="pubsub-message-bus-and-realtime-communications">Pubsub message bus and realtime communications</h2>

<p>The pubsub communication model boasts some properties that are
attractive to <em>a real time</em> application.  Specifically, messages can
be sent and delivered efficiently with little delay, provided none of
the resources are over burdened.</p>

<h2 id="decoupling-the-controller-from-control-object">Decoupling the Controller from Control Object</h2>

<p>Traditionally, the software, and most likely the hardware intrinsicly
ties a particular device with a specific controller.  For example, a
Joystick or Keyboard.  Replacing, say the keyboard with Joystick
control requires new  software to be added to the controlled item, as
well as created for the controller.</p>

<p>It also opens up opportunity for logging, learning, testing and
replays!</p>

<p>Keyboards, programs or canned messages can be formed to sned the same
communication.</p>

<h3 id="talk-to-the-bus">Talk to The Bus</h3>

<p>All entities talk to the bus, and read from the bus.  No two
components speak directly to one another.  This allows an incredible
amount of flexibility, but it does add a level of abstraction and
compexity.</p>

<h4 id="publishers">Publishers</h4>

<p>Adding a message bus requires us to adjust from a tight,
input -&gt; output coupling to a <em>decoupled</em> intention based messaging
system.</p>

<p>For example, a Joystick can publish rapid stick movement /
positioning informaiton to an MQTT bus such that <em>subscribers</em> like
the <em>Control software</em>, a logger or debugger as well.</p>

<p>A temprature sensor may send out periodic temprature. Distance, light,
heat and other sensor can periodical advertise to appropriate
channels.</p>

<h2 id="funcation-call-rest-vs-pub-sub">Funcation Call, REST vs. Pub/Sub</h2>

<p>[Todo] put a link here to a page that compares communication models:
such as Routing Protocols, Web/REST servers, RealTime sockets,
Real-time Websockets, real time messaging.</p>

<h3 id="mbr-and-the-pubsub-commuication-model">MBR and the Pubsub Commuication Model</h3>

<p>For our application, we will be controlling a set of DC motors through
a micro-controller (i.e. Arduino with shield) attached via some
serial/RF/BT/??? mechanism.</p>

<p>For this project we will focus on the MQTT protocol and we will
specifically use <em>Mosquitto</em> the MQTT broker.</p>

<p>useful for many types of computer communication,
including <em>real time</em> control software, like we use to drive our
mobile vehicle.  This article will go into detail on our controll
system software and the various components required to make it happen!</p>

<p>The MQTT message server a general purpose as a systems message bus our
project components can use to read and write data in near realtime.
This data is used for a number of purposes, to advertise changes to
control inputs and sensors, publish control messages to motor
controllors and by the dashboard to display our realtime sensor
data. This describes how our MQTT bus is being used and how we got it
all hooked up!</p>

<h2 id="mqtt-bus-uses">MQTT Bus Uses</h2>

<ul>
<li>Advertise Joystick inputs for vehicle control</li>
<li>Advertise Sensor readings for sensor networks</li>
<li>Consume vehical controls by the motor controllers</li>
<li>Consume all sorts of data for the Dashboard and realtime graphs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>Mosquitto MQTT Broker is running on a system wide Raspberry Pi. All
sensor and control inputs are written to the appropriate topics on the
MQTT bus.</p>

<p>In the future we&rsquo;ll want to run an MQTT bus on vehical incase we
loose contact with our control station.</p>

<p>I have created a python / Flask based server to run on the Raspberry
accepting REST calls to perform application specific functions.</p>

<p>I have created a flask server that will accept REST requests to
control the PiCamera, AdaFruitMotorSheild and other stuff.</p>

<p>Refer to the PiCamera documentation here:
<a href="https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/">https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/</a>.</p>

<p>The software can be found in <a href="http://github.com/mobilerobot-io/rpid">github
repository</a>.</p>

<p>And how to write and operate a flask based server for your project.</p>

<p>The next task is to turn video streaming On and Off, this may require
duping and modifying somewhat a python script &hellip;</p>

		    Otto the Pluggable Macro Controller Micro Service
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    

<p>Otto is a small, simple <em>micro-server</em> written in Go. It handles
requisit communications and related infra structure required by
servers and controllers.  The applications and functionality will be
provided via pluggins.</p>

<p>Otto can run as a REST server in a data center or the controller on
micro-controller type of computer.  Otto was developed with the notion
that much of the code that makes for a good server (or any application
for that matter) requires redundant but import supporting
infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="otto-core">Otto Core</h2>

<p>The Otto core provides the following support out of the box, available
to all plugins that require these services out of the box.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Communication Handlers for REST, HTML, SPA, Websocket and MQTT
Messaging.  Additionally: Configuration Management, Logging, Stats
Collection and Plugin Management</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The plugins can be combined in any combination to achieve precisely
the functionality needed for a given circumstance.</p>

<h2 id="current-plugins">Current Plugins</h2>

<p>Plugins are very simple to write, they are basically <em>Go Plugins</em> with
public Name() and Register() functions.  The Register() function
essentially registers handlers with otto to recieve events and
corresponding event info.</p>

<p>This is the current list of otto plugins.  Plugins can be written
anywhere and loaded by Otto.  These just happen to share Otto&rsquo;s
repository.</p>

<ul>
<li>Echo  ~ send data, or a message and get it back.</li>
<li>Store ~ persistant storage of Go objects as JSON strings</li>
<li>Dork  ~ cloud based compute and storage monitor</li>
<li>Wally ~ website page walker / scrapper</li>
<li>Monty ~ mico-controller monitoring program</li>
</ul>
