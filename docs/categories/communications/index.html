		    MQTT For Controllor Communication
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    <p>The MQTT message bus is a simple but critical element of our MBR
software design.  MQTT provides what is known as a <em>publish/suscribe</em>
or <em>pubsub</em> communications model.  This model of machine to machine
communication has some attractive benefits for realtime driving
algorithms that we will discuss in this post.</p>

<h2 id="pubsub-message-bus-and-realtime-communications">Pubsub message bus and realtime communications</h2>

<p>The pubsub communication model boasts some properties that are
attractive to <em>a real time</em> application.  Specifically, messages can
be sent and delivered efficiently with little delay, provided none of
the resources are over burdened.</p>

<h2 id="decoupling-the-controller-from-control-object">Decoupling the Controller from Control Object</h2>

<p>Traditionally, the software, and most likely the hardware intrinsicly
ties a particular device with a specific controller.  For example, a
Joystick or Keyboard.  Replacing, say the keyboard with Joystick
control requires new  software to be added to the controlled item, as
well as created for the controller.</p>

<p>Keyboards, programs or canned messages can be formed to sned the same
communication.</p>

<h3 id="talk-to-the-bus">Talk to The Bus</h3>

<p>All entities talk to the bus, and read from the bus.  No two
components speak directly to one another.  This allows an incredible
amount of flexibility, but it does add a level of abstraction and
compexity.</p>

<h4 id="publishers">Publishers</h4>

<p>Adding a message bus requires us to adjust from a tight,
input -&gt; output coupling to a <em>decoupled</em> intention based messaging
system.</p>

<p>For example, a Joystick can publish rapid stick movement /
positioning informaiton to an MQTT bus such that <em>subscribers</em> like
the <em>Control software</em>, a logger or debugger as well.</p>

<p>A temprature sensor may send out periodic temprature. Distance, light,
heat and other sensor can periodical advertise to appropriate
channels.</p>

<h2 id="funcation-call-rest-vs-pub-sub">Funcation Call, REST vs. Pub/Sub</h2>

<p>[Todo] put a link here to a page that compares communication models:
such as Routing Protocols, Web/REST servers, RealTime sockets,
Real-time Websockets, real time messaging.</p>

<h3 id="mbr-and-the-pubsub-commuication-model">MBR and the Pubsub Commuication Model</h3>

<p>For our application, we will be controlling a set of DC motors through
a micro-controller (i.e. Arduino with shield) attached via some
serial/RF/BT/??? mechanism.</p>

<p>For this project we will focus on the MQTT protocol and we will
specifically use <em>Mosquitto</em> the MQTT broker.</p>

<p>useful for many types of computer communication,
including <em>real time</em> control software, like we use to drive our
mobile vehicle.  This article will go into detail on our controll
system software and the various components required to make it happen!</p>

<p>The MQTT message server a general purpose as a systems message bus our
project components can use to read and write data in near realtime.
This data is used for a number of purposes, to advertise changes to
control inputs and sensors, publish control messages to motor
controllors and by the dashboard to display our realtime sensor
data. This describes how our MQTT bus is being used and how we got it
all hooked up!</p>

<h2 id="mqtt-bus-uses">MQTT Bus Uses</h2>

<ul>
<li>Advertise Joystick inputs for vehicle control</li>
<li>Advertise Sensor readings for sensor networks</li>
<li>Consume vehical controls by the motor controllers</li>
<li>Consume all sorts of data for the Dashboard and realtime graphs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>Mosquitto MQTT Broker is running on a system wide Raspberry Pi. All
sensor and control inputs are written to the appropriate topics on the
MQTT bus.</p>

<p>In the future we&rsquo;ll want to run an MQTT bus on vehical incase we
loose contact with our control station.</p>

		    TLV the Type Length Vector Protocol
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
		    <p>TLV is a very simple communication protocol that can be used to send
messages around a complex, distributed system.</p>

<p>The TLV protocol provides only message formatting by definition.  How
the application handles said messages is up to the application, that
is NO assumptions or gaurauntees about losing message, parts of
messages, ordering or retransmission.</p>

<p>If any of these more advanced capabilities are to be provided, they
must be done so at the application layer (so to speak).</p>

<h3 id="generic-underlying-transports">Generic Underlying Transports</h3>

<p>The underlying physical and mac layers will have a huge effect on the
possibility of packet loss, ordering, delay and possible bandwidth.
Each of the communicaiton mediums we use, we will post a comparison of
characteristics, bandwidth, delay and reliability amoung other
things.</p>

<h2 id="tlv-and-tlstring">TLV and TLString</h2>

<p>Type, Length Vector (Value) is as old as the hills, but still just as
useful!  Type length Vector is byte oriented, with three types of
messages: compact (1 byte), short (2 bytes) and full (up to 0xffff
size).</p>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  Type  | Length | Value  ...
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
</code></pre>

<p>The first byte is the type of message, the second byte is the length
of the message, inclusive, that is the 2 bytes of the Tyte and Length
field are INCLUDED in the Length of the message.</p>

<h3 id="compact-messages">Compact Messages</h3>

<p>The nature of many types of communication are just quick short
messages that only require a single byte, which not only determines
the <em>type</em> of message, it also supplies <em>no payload</em> beyond the type.</p>

<p>In this case, TLV supports the message type <strong>compact</strong> or
<strong>1-byte</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="short-messages">Short Messages</h3>

<p>In a similar vein, some types my contain only a single value, for
example a sensor value between 0 &amp; 0xff can be advertised with only
two bytes.</p>

<p>Normally, a two byte message: 1-byte for type and 1 byte for the
length would require a 3rd byte for the value.  Hence, that makes the
two byte message unused.</p>

<p>To that end, we provide a 2nd small optimization: Short messages
support the message type and a message value between 0x0 and 0xff in
the length field, thus reducing the <em>Short Message</em> from 3 bytes to 2
bytes.</p>

<h3 id="distinguishing-compact-short-and-normal-packets">Distinguishing Compact, Short and Normal Packets</h3>

<p>The packet types can be identified by the first two bytes of the type
field.  Compact packets always have the first two bits of the type
set:</p>

<h4 id="compact-packets">Compact Packets</h4>

<pre><code>+--------+
|11xxxxxx|
+--------+
</code></pre>

<p>Compact packets are a single byte in the <strong>range of 0xC0 to 0xFF</strong>,
depending on how the remaining 2^6 bits are set.</p>

<h4 id="short-packets">Short Packets</h4>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+
|10xxxxxx| Value  |
+--------+--------+
</code></pre>

<h4 id="reserved-packets">Reserved Packets</h4>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+
|01xxxxxx| Value  |
+--------+--------+

The reserved range can be associated with the Short or Regular packet
types is one type is getting used up quicker than another.

</code></pre>

<p>Short packets are two bytes, with the type value in the range of 0x80
to 0xBF.  Again, short packets have (2^6 = 32)  independent types.</p>

<h4 id="regular-packets">Regular Packets</h4>

<pre><code>+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|00  Type  | Length | Value  ...
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
</code></pre>

<p>If desired, the compact and short packets can be turned off,
altogether allocating the entire 2^8 == 256 types to be regular
messages.</p>
