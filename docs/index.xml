      <description>This was a simple but very cool project. Setup an Arduino Nano with a Joystick inputs with an RF output back to a control station (or the vehicle if control software resides on vehical).
Requirements Develop a wireless Remote Control capable of controlling (i.e. send inputs to control software) able to control the vehicles motion.
The Joystick must be able to communicate wirelessley.
 RF - required and PoC is complete Wifi optional and desired Blue Tooth optional and desired  Design Our first cut at the Joystick is very simple.</description>

      <description>You need to push the RESET button to get them to write flash.
A power packed chip that I have just started playing with. Give some quick specs here: and compare with other well known options (arduino&amp;rsquo;s, stm32 or Raspberry Pi.
Quick Feature Recap Coolness beyond the Arduino Some of the interesting things that set this chip apart from the arduino, also pitfalls that come along with this more advanced chip.</description>

      <title>7inch Touch Screen by Element 14</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/inventory/rpi-7inch-touch-screen-element14/</link>

      <description>This 7 inch touch screen display attaches directly to a modern raspberry Pi (upto B+ 2017 module).
Todo: verify whether, or not this display can be attached to a Raspberry Pi Zero or not.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are going to build a simple control station that begins with a
Raspberry Pi and connected &lt;em&gt;7 inch touchscreen tablet&lt;/em&gt;.  I have it
setup in &amp;ldquo;kiosk mode&amp;rdquo;, which is basically full page chrome without the
tabs and tool bars etc.

      <description>I quickly outgrew my first introductory robotics kit. I started with my first Robotic Kit (actually 4 of them), I choose the kits that provided the chassis only, after all, I did not know if I would want to base it on a Raspberry Pi or Arduino (or both), perhaps something else entirely? Follow the story and find out what happened:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLV is a very simple communication protocol that can be used to send
messages around a complex, distributed system.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>This RC reciever chip is very easy to use out of the box, yet provides some very sophisticated capabilities. The first project We&amp;rsquo;ll start using this chip will be a remote control Joystick for our mobile robot.

      <description>Our control station will run a 7in touch panel attached to a Raspberry Pi with various periphereals attached. To this end, it is a simple, self contained webserver UI written Go.
Plugins keep it real Otto accepts plugins that allow new functionality to be added by simply implementing the simple interface specific in the interface specification.
Otto GUI Otto comes with a built in GUI (HTML) interface as well as a provide REST interface and MQTT message bus.</description>
