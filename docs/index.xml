      <description>&lt;p&gt;We want to build a self&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Robot must be able to navigate while controlled by a human or
software, it must be modular, extensible and configurable.  Interested

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We want to build an automous driven vehicle that can film and stream
video from under my house, for under USD $500.  The vehical must also
be able to communicate select sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the beautiful things about &lt;em&gt;robotics&lt;/em&gt; are the wide variety of
disciplines involved to successfully build and operate even the most
basic of robots, let alone something of the scale that we are planning
to build. Read more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have created my first (but not last diagram with Draw.IO). I guess the important part is incorporating the SVG graphics. They are so clean and scalable, however they can also be automated and linked from.

      <description>Project Definition Our mobile robot is going to need a remote control, may as well be a joystick. Yes, we do have high hopes of getting the vehicle to drive itself, we are still going to support a Human controlled switch over.
Following is a quick-n-dirty block diagram of the project design.
RF Remote Control Electronics The first pass at the remote control will be a single joystick on the RC station.</description>

      <description>Nick Gammon does a great job describing interupts on the Arduino, when and I why you might want to use them. As an overly summarized version, if you want to be able to get a notification when data has arrived without having to sleep and poll for data.
Talk about Ardiuno interupts, non-blocking I/O and Nearly Real Time OS. This is a very good, and very indepth article.

      <description>Problem Definition When setting out to create a Mobile Robot one is faced with a lot of choices, like how does the robot steer or control itself? Does it have, legs, wheels or tracks? How will it be controlled, through computer vision, distance sensors or humans?
What Platform and Language? You are also have to ask the question, what platform will all this run on? Arduino for the sharper hardware support or the raspberry pi and it&amp;rsquo;s superior computing capabilities and software support?</description>

      <description>It has hit me in very clear term, It has occured to me how big of a challenge it is to create the mechanical housing, with all the cooling, cable management, room for power, be modular and easy to maintian.
Oh yea, all the while maintaining the optimized motors, suspension, steering and drive train.
Well here we go. It first started to occur to me after I built the first robot vehical &amp;ldquo;kit&amp;rdquo; when I routed a few wires incorrectly, then wanted to add a couple more components.</description>

      <description>One of the first issues that we came against was the specific configurations of the micro-controllers as well and the number and configuration of pins and hardware particulars.
Macro-Micro Controllers The system should be flexible enough to allow one or more macro-controls communicating with one or more micro-controllers.
Communication Mechanism We have a rather complex set of communication requirements, we have signals between sensors, motors and micro-controllers. We also have the communication from the micro-controllers and the macro-controller.</description>

      <description>When I first started tinkering with the Arduino, about mid 2018, (yea I know, I am waaaaay late to the game) It was so easy to find great tutorials, but that changed quickly once you start filling up the pins you need.

      <description>Booting a Raspberry Pi from an SD card or USB stick is pretty neat and all, but they are inadequate for sustainded, reliable production use.
The quality of the SD comes into question immediately. Even the best of SD cards can go south out of nowhere! I do not know much about sd cards at all, except that I have blasted through about 12 of them this with 3 RPI&amp;rsquo;s (and a BeableBone), that is too expensive.</description>

Zero Downtime Software Also, how can we manage the software on a live robot? This sounds like a job for industrial strength, distributed system with a friendly API. Is it possible?
Oh, it has to be all OpenSource. It is entirely acceptable, and preferable to use other well established Open Source products.</description>

      <description>Limitations of Hardware The Arduino is the workhorse of the maker world, for very good reason, but I quickly realized I was running out of pins for all the things I wanted to attach to Arduino.
A motorshield on one Arduino, and a large number of sensors will overwhelm the hardware power of one of these devices. More important, the processing power can easily become overwhelmed with some of the smarts required for the driving algorightms and moving time-series data into the clowd.</description>
