      <description>Skid steering basics
 Based on fixed direction wheels[1] or tracks There are two groups or sides of wheels: left and right All wheels in a group MUST always point in the same direction All wheels in a group MUST always rotate at the same rate Direction is determined by the speed of the two wheel groups  To move straight all motors rotate at the same rate Forward and Reverse are determined by positive and negative values Turning is achieved by varying the throttle on the right and left   Example The Skidder class has the following API, as you can see all of the movements we desire can be accomplished with a single API call</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was to build a simple automous driving vehical using a
Raspberry Pi and a simple DC motor controller.  That is a single RPi
will act as the macro controller managing communications and making
control decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are going to build a simple control station that begins with a
Raspberry Pi and connected &lt;em&gt;7 inch touchscreen tablet&lt;/em&gt;.  I have it
setup in &amp;ldquo;kiosk mode&amp;rdquo;, which is basically full page chrome without the
tabs and tool bars etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://mobilerobot.io/projects/tlv-and-realitime-communication/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLV is a very simple communication protocol that can be used to send
messages around a complex, distributed system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Control Station App</title>

      <guid>http://mobilerobot.io/projects/control-station-webapp/</guid>
      <description>Our control station will run a 7in touch panel attached to a Raspberry Pi with various periphereals attached. To this end, it is a simple, self contained webserver UI written Go.
Plugins keep it real Otto accepts plugins that allow new functionality to be added by simply implementing the simple interface specific in the interface specification.
Otto GUI Otto comes with a built in GUI (HTML) interface as well as a provide REST interface and MQTT message bus.</description>

      <guid>http://mobilerobot.io/projects/rpi-flask-mqtt-server/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This application provides access and control to various Raspberry
devices like the camera, GPIO pins, or a possible MotorShield if
needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Raspbery Pi Camera Control Service</title>
      <link>http://mobilerobot.io/projects/rpi-camera-control-service/</link>

      <guid>http://mobilerobot.io/projects/rpi-camera-control-service/</guid>
      <description>I have created a python / Flask based server to run on the Raspberry accepting REST calls to perform application specific functions.
I have created a flask server that will accept REST requests to control the PiCamera, AdaFruitMotorSheild and other stuff.
Refer to the PiCamera documentation here: https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/.
The software can be found in github repository.
And how to write and operate a flask based server for your project.</description>

      <title>Inexpensive Motor Controllers for Arduino and Raspberry Pi</title>
      <link>http://mobilerobot.io/notes/motor-controlor-notes/</link>

      <guid>http://mobilerobot.io/notes/motor-controlor-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use an Arduino with a Motor Controller over say a
Raspberry Pi with a motor-controller.  I believe the Arudino has
better support for dedicated Real-time software vs. the Raspberry Pi
and as a superior platform for general computing including running
Control Software.  This is how we do it on the West side &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IP Multicast the basics</title>

      <guid>http://mobilerobot.io/notes/ip-multicast/</guid>
      <description>IP Multicast addresses The typical IP addresses used by computers networking today are known as unicast addresses, meaning that every unicast address as a single (physical or logical) end point.
Most all computer networking is point to point between two specific IP addresses, you name it: web browsing, email exchange, transfer files and so much more.
However, there are other more specific forms on communication available and occasionally used: Broadcast and Multicast.</description>

      <title>Otto the Pluggable Macro Controller Micro Service</title>

      <guid>http://mobilerobot.io/projects/otto-master-controller-micro-service/</guid>
      <description>Otto is a small, simple micro-server written in Go. It handles requisit communications and related infra structure required by servers and controllers. The applications and functionality will be provided via pluggins.
Otto can run as a REST server in a data center or the controller on micro-controller type of computer. Otto was developed with the notion that much of the code that makes for a good server (or any application for that matter) requires redundant but import supporting infrastructure.</description>
