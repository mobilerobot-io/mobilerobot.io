      <description>&lt;p&gt;We want to build a self&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Robot must be able to navigate while controlled by a human or
software, it must be modular, extensible and configurable.  Interested
in the project? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We want to build an automous driven vehicle that can film and stream
video from under my house, for under USD $500.  The vehical must also
be able to communicate select sensor data.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the beautiful things about &lt;em&gt;robotics&lt;/em&gt; are the wide variety of
disciplines involved to successfully build and operate even the most
basic of robots, let alone something of the scale that we are planning
to build. Read more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this point in our R&amp;amp;D we are leaning toward an overall design that
looks something like this (and subject to change at any knee jerk

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will use a Raspberry Pi as the main on unit controller.  The
Raspberry Pi will be attached via one of the common local bus
protocols (i2c, SPI or Canbus).  Read More &amp;hellip;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is where we start communicating (or socializing) or designs.  We
sincerly want to get qualified opinions and advice regarding our
designs.

      <description>I flashed the onbaord LED and I made the RGB LED change colors. It is powered with a old style mini (small) USB adaptor.
I was able to connect the Arduino Nanos to the I2C bus created for internal communications.
Power can be brought in through a 5v Vin pin.</description>

      <description>When I first started tinkering with the Arduino, about mid 2018, (yea I know, I am waaaaay late to the game) It was so easy to find great tutorials, but that changed quickly once you start filling up the pins you need.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Tank roams about, it will be gathering and transmitting data
according to the application, that data will be collected, by a
collector and sent to storage.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I lead a team at Cisco Systems to build a system that would deliver
streaming video to millions of users, simultaneously. That same
technology has been used by DIRECTV, TimeWarner Cable, AT&amp;amp;T and
other major

function.

      <description>Booting a Raspberry Pi from an SD card or USB stick is pretty neat and all, but they are inadequate for sustainded, reliable production use.
The quality of the SD comes into question immediately. Even the best of SD cards can go south out of nowhere! I do not know much about sd cards at all, except that I have blasted through about 12 of them this with 3 RPI&amp;rsquo;s (and a BeableBone), that is too expensive.</description>

Batteries are the key factor.
Make a list of my various power supplies.
Also make a link to the Youtube video that shows how to make a multi voltage power supply from an old PC power supply.</description>

sprinkler systems, to cars and jet airplanes, laptops, cell phones and

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The body and drive train of the Robot will determine if our project is
going to actually function in the real world.  It all starts with a
design in mind, choices of materials, the design of all functional
components, mobility, motion and durability of the project.
