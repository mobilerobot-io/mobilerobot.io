      <description>You need to push the RESET button to get them to write flash.
A power packed chip that I have just started playing with. Give some quick specs here: and compare with other well known options (arduino&amp;rsquo;s, stm32 or Raspberry Pi.
Quick Feature Recap Coolness beyond the Arduino Some of the interesting things that set this chip apart from the arduino, also pitfalls that come along with this more advanced chip.</description>

      <description>This RC reciever chip is very easy to use out of the box, yet provides some very sophisticated capabilities. The first project We&amp;rsquo;ll start using this chip will be a remote control Joystick for our mobile robot.
