      <description>&lt;p&gt;We want to build a self&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Robot must be able to navigate while controlled by a human or
software, it must be modular, extensible and configurable.  Interested
in the project?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I flashed the onbaord LED and I made the RGB LED change colors. It is powered with a old style mini (small) USB adaptor.
I was able to connect the Arduino Nanos to the I2C bus created for internal communications.
Power can be brought in through a 5v Vin pin.</description>

      <description>When I first started tinkering with the Arduino, about mid 2018, (yea I know, I am waaaaay late to the game) It was so easy to find great tutorials, but that changed quickly once you start filling up the pins you need.
 The Whole is Greater than the sum of the parts

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Tank roams about, it will be gathering and transmitting data
according to the application, that data will be collected, by a
collector and sent to storage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I lead a team at Cisco Systems to build a system that would deliver
streaming video to millions of users, simultaneously. That same
technology has been used by DIRECTV, TimeWarner Cable, AT&amp;amp;T and
other major&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Booting a Raspberry Pi from an SD card or USB stick is pretty neat and all, but they are inadequate for sustainded, reliable production use.
The quality of the SD comes into question immediately. Even the best of SD cards can go south out of nowhere! I do not know much about sd cards at all, except that I have blasted through about 12 of them this with 3 RPI&amp;rsquo;s (and a BeableBone), that is too expensive.</description>

will end up being a lot of work, if that site is to become

      <description>Different options for powering robots. Stationary, near electrical outlets is always the easiest, but does not bode well for mobile and autonomous.
Batteries are the key factor.
Make a list of my various power supplies.
Also make a link to the Youtube video that shows how to make a multi voltage power supply from an old PC power supply.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is full of things that rely on software to work, from
sprinkler systems, to cars and jet airplanes, laptops, cell phones and
drones.  You name it everything. Now lets consider how we use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The body and drive train of the Robot will determine if our project is
going to actually function in the real world.  It all starts with a
design in mind, choices of materials, the design of all functional
components, mobility, motion and durability of the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
