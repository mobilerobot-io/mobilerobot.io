      <description>&lt;p&gt;The MQTT message server a general purpose as a systems message bus our
project components can use to read and write data in near realtime.
This data is used for a number of purposes, to advertise changes to
control inputs and sensors, publish control messages to motor
controllors and by the dashboard to display our realtime sensor
data. This describes how our MQTT bus is being used and how we got it
all hooked up!

      <description>Otto is a small, simple micro-server written in Go. It handles requisit communications and related infra structure required by servers and controllers. The applications and functionality will be provided via pluggins.
Otto can run as a REST server in a data center or the controller on micro-controller type of computer. Otto was developed with the notion that much of the code that makes for a good server (or any application for that matter) requires redundant but import supporting infrastructure.</description>
