      <description>Booting a Raspberry Pi from an SD card or USB stick is pretty neat and all, but they are inadequate for sustainded, reliable production use.
The quality of the SD comes into question immediately. Even the best of SD cards can go south out of nowhere! I do not know much about sd cards at all, except that I have blasted through about 12 of them this with 3 RPI&amp;rsquo;s (and a BeableBone), that is too expensive.</description>
