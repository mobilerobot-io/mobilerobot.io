      <description>This was a simple but very cool project. Setup an Arduino Nano with a Joystick inputs with an RF output back to a control station (or the vehicle if control software resides on vehical).
Requirements Develop a wireless Remote Control capable of controlling (i.e. send inputs to control software) able to control the vehicles motion.
The Joystick must be able to communicate wirelessley.
 RF - required and PoC is complete Wifi optional and desired Blue Tooth optional and desired  Design Our first cut at the Joystick is very simple.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever started to build a mobile robot and first started this
project I set out to pick up motor controller and a platform to
buildMy Tom&amp;rsquo;s vehicle around. The two most on his choices at least to
me were a Raspberry Pie or an Arduino.  As I found out selecting
either platform I choose it would have been a bad idea, and here is
why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
