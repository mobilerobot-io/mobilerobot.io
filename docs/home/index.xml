      <description>We are going to attempt to build a robot that will film the underside of my house, as well as collect some sensor data like heat and moisture.
A major goal will be building a self navigating vehicle, although human override will be available. The most valuable input for self navigating vehicals is computer vision, hence we will also spend a considerable amount of time with the vision subsystem. /project/</description>

      <description>Robots are by definition are mechanical, and hence require a significant knowledge of both Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science and good old fasion Farmers Knowledge.
Mechanics are a concenrn for a number of reasons:
 What should we use? we need to be concerned about, weight, strength and cost. But we also need to consider how easy or difficult is it to customize, manipulate and maintain&amp;hellip; Design of moving, mechanical parts. Wheels, articulating arms and drive chasiss are just a couple examples.</description>

      <description>To Be the majority of robots out in the market today are either toys or educational things with the intent of introducing people to robotics.
On the other end On the other end of the spectrum you have the companies like Tesla (hybrid driven) and Uber (fully autonomous) driven vehicles.
Robots for Normal People! But what about us normal people? The small Mom n Pop and local manufactures shops or dedicated Weekend Warriors?</description>

      <description>As it turns out, computer vision is the primary sensor used by robots to drive. Many other methods are avaliable, and quite effective given the appropriate application.
Follow the Lines For example robots that are part of an automated CNC manufacturing system may operate perfectly fine by following colored lines on the floor, but a vehical that drives on the streets, or one that drives in &amp;ldquo;uncharted territory&amp;rdquo; does not have the luxury of pre-painted lines.</description>

      <description>Processors and electronics in general have dropped in price to such an extent that virtually anybody that can afford a cell phone can begin to work on any one of millions of ideas or projects, robots being just one example.
OpenSource Wins! Finally, after 3 decades of battling backward minded people in charge, OpenSource software has finally become the norm.
Of course the amount of money saved by using open source software is significant, and sometimes even HUGE, but we have one much more important reason OpenSource is critical is the Freedom.</description>
